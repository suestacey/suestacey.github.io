<h2>Tower</h2>
<p class="standard_M">You have reached the point of greatest liberation, as you have nothing holding you back. Now you can begin to make dramatic changes within yourself, rebuilding without the waste and illusion of the past. As you have nothing, any direction will be appropriate. Out of change comes a more natural relationship to the world.  Allow your intellect and intuition to be equal partners as you face challenges. Both have powerful guidance to offer you concerning limitations you have created for yourself. Unforseen change. Danger, crisis, destruction, liberation, misery, distress, indigence, adversity, calamity, disgrace, deception, ruin. 
</p>
