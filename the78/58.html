<h2>7 of Swords</h2>
<p class="standard_M">An opportunity to withdraw from a hopeless situation and fight another day. Disengagement from a struggle you should never have been involved in. A desperate attempt to resolve a matter without conflict. The use of cleverness or outright deception to turn the tide in your favor. 
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayHead">Reverse
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">
Being trapped in a hopeless situation and unable to withdraw. A feat of daring that is too much for you to handle. Being caught in the middle of a desperate act of cunning or outright deception.
