<h2>Daughter of Discs</h2>
<p class="standard_M">The surprising appearance of new prosperity and opportunities for advance in the physical world. One who delights in the pleasures of the body, material things, and nature. The embrace of hard work, realistic goals, and scholarly perseverance as a means to create solid achievement. Dependability, trust, and a studious nature. May portend a new job or promotion. Willingness to take responsibility for something greater than oneself. Love, courage and dedication. Inner beauty. 
</p>
<p class="standard_MGrayHead">Reverse
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">The dark side of charm. Unfavorable news about business, finance, or the physical world. One who delights in all forms of luxury and physical excess, leaving practical matters unattended. Irrationality and failure to recognize obvious facts, coupled with a poor work ethic. Wastefulness, lack of focus, and loss. May portend the loss of a job or promotion.
