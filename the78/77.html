<h2>King of Swords</h2>
<p class="standard_M">
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayHead">Reverse
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">A mature leader of unyielding ethics and absolute authority. An incorruptible judge, whose devotion to the letter of the law cannot be swayed by emotion, mercy, or exigent circumstances. Perfect clarity of thought, excessive use of force, and mastery of language as a tool for deception. One who, like a great tyrant, inspires not love or devotion, but fear, respect, and obedience.
