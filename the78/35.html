<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">
New and unusual relationships and opportunities. The reawakening of your appetite for life or love. The path of excess leading to spiritual rejuvenation and the appearance of novel ambitions. Letting your mind wander at critical times. Mixing business with pleasure to your detriment. Being unaware of what is going on around you. Feeling lethargic, lazy, or apathetic. In the creative process: Relax into playfulness, whimsically experiment with improvisation or reminiscence about past experiences. Such meditations alleviate stress and refresh the imagination. Make space for the gifts of spirit to move through you.
