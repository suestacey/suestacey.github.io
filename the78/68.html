<h2>Queen of Cups</h2>
<p class="standard_M">



Spirituality, maturity, and grace. A natural counselor and healer, One whose relaxed presence seems to embody deep love and spirituality. A tranquil poet who reflects the nature of the observer. The embrace of all things dreamlike and receptive, such as perfect and unconditional love.

<p class="standard_MGrayHead">Reverse
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">A melodramatic scene stealer. A sentimental hypochondriac. A person prey to wild and shifting emotional fancies.
