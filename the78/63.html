<h2>Son of Wands</h2>
<p class="standard_M">Someone who is passionate, impulsive, and thrives on excitement and new challenges. The surprising appearance of a new passion or inflammatory news. A trickster who can unexpectedly ignite a dangerous situation. The intensity and childish imagination that can send even the most stable venture spinning wildly out of control. Can represent a person outwardly timid, but harboring unexpected inner fury. May indicate the birth of a child. Constantly seeking new adventures. They aren't someone to stick around when things get boring or stagnant. Life of the party, they know how to be suave (but it can be hard to tell when they're just blowing smoke). Fired-up about life, and always engaged in one thing or another.  Dominates spaces with their need for attention. Can be demanding and loud, not to mention arrogant. Asserts themselves with confidence, and at the same time, they need a lot of validation to keep that confidence rolling.

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">
One filled with vitality and limitless appetite. A sexy and exciting person, obsessed with style and outward appearance, overconfident in their abilities, and foolhardy in their actions. A hot temper and domineering nature, coupled with a love of false drama and all things theatrical. Anxiety over remaining in one place or with one person for too long. The rapid approach, or more likely departure, of someone or something that ruptures your world. Often suggests travel as the result of discord, or cruel indifference.
