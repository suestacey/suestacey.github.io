<h2>Son of Wands</h2>
<p class="standard_M">Constantly seeking new adventures. They aren't someone to stick around when things get boring or stagnant. Life of the party, they know how to be suave (but it can be hard to tell when they're just blowing smoke). Fired-up about life, and always engaged in one thing or another.  Dominates spaces with their need for attention. Can be demanding and loud, not to mention arrogant. Asserts themselves with confidence â€“ yet at the same time, they need a lot of validation to keep that confidence rolling. Someone who is passionate, impulsive, and thrives on excitement and new challenges.
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayHead">Reverse
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">The surprising appearance of a new passion or inflammatory news. A trickster who can unexpectedly ignite a dangerous situation. The intensity and childish imagination that can send even the most stable venture spinning wildly out of control. Can represent a person outwardly timid, but harboring unexpected inner fury. May indicate the birth of a child.
