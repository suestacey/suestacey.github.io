<h2>Son of Wands</h2>
<p class="standard_M">The Son of Wands is constantly seeking new adventures. They aren't someone to stick around when things get boring or stagnant. They're the life of the party, they know how to be suave (but it can be hard to tell when they're just blowing smoke). They're fired-up about life, and always engaged in one thing or another.
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayHead">Reverse
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">The surprising appearance of a new passion or inflammatory news. A trickster who can unexpectedly ignite a dangerous situation. The intensity and childish imagination that can send even the most stable venture spinning wildly out of control. Can represent a person outwardly timid, but harboring unexpected inner fury. May indicate the birth of a child.
