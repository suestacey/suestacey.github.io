<h2>Devil</h2>
<p class="standard_M">Your viewpoint is dominated by the faults in your friends and associates - pride, arrogance, jealousy, greed, emptiness. While these flaws may exist in others, your current perception of them may be a projection. Do you feel you are living superficially? If so, do something practical. The Devil manipulates us through logic. Don't fight the devil on their own ground. The cycle of negative thinking is best combated with creative work. Put your fingers in the clay, the paint, the dish water. Make yourself too busy to be critical.
