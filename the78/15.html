<h2>Devil</h2>
<p class="standard_M">Your viewpoint is dominated by the faults in your friends and associates - pride, arrogance, jealousy, greed, emptiness. While these flaws may exist in others, your current perception of them may be a projection. Do you feel you are living superficially? If so, do something practical. The Devil manipulates us through logic. Don't fight the devil on his own ground. The cycle of negative thinking is best combatted with creative work. Put your fingers in the clay, the paint, the dish water. Make yourself too busy to be critical.  You will be faced with decisions and you will feel you don't have nearly enough information. Use your intellect, resurrect your native intuition, combine these sources of information, and take action, even if you are unsure of the outcome. It is better to try and fail than to err through omission.  The outcome depends on unseen factors. Do your homework and prepare carefully, but be ready to act without hesitation. Success may depend on spontaneity.

The pursuit of higher goals despite the influence of luxury and pleasure. Release from obsession with money and power. Resistance to temptations. Freedom from bondage. Liberation from fear, weakness and indecision through communion with higher powers or the inner voice.
