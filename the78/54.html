A challenge to mutual understanding. Transcending emotional or erotic stress. A conflict of wills that adds to the excitement of a relationship. Intoxicating mutual obsession. A decisive attitude readjustment. Concern over a rival motivates you to proper action. Realizing the things you take for granted. Putting your heads together helps. In the creative process: When loss of understanding triggers pain and creative numbing, stay close to the people involved, this is a point of transition.
