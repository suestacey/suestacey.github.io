<p class="bigGolds">Wheel of Fortune


</p><p class="standard_QP">Luck or no luck.  </p><br>

<p class="standard_M">

The central theme of The Wheel of Fortune card is cyclical change. The wheel keeps on rolling, churning events in a ceaseless progression of ups and downs, either way freeing us from the past. No one can escape its cyclical action, which can feel somewhat terrifying - no matter whether we are rising or falling. When one is balanced on top of the wheel, there is a moment of crystal clarity. However, the only part of the wheel that's actually not going up and down is the hub, which represents your eternal self. Every one of us will occupy all the points on the wheel at one point or another. The cycle of the wheel is its lesson - and we can learn to take comfort in it. If you don't like the look of things right now, just wait - things will change. Of course, if you do like the look of things right now, enjoy it while it lasts, because that will change too.

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">Winds of change make old visions obsolete. An act of god or stroke of bad luck. Inner turmoil cleverly disguised but unrestrained. Getting the run-around. Reaching a turning point. A good time to honor your gods.
