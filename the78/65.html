<h2>King of Wands</h2>
<p class="standard_M">
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayHead">Reverse
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">An exciting and reckless leader who inspires others to irresponsible acts. An artist whose depraved love of chaos causes him to take hold of destructive ideas and make them appealing to the masses. One who is charismatic and intimidating, using demonstrations of his own skill to dupe others into accepting responsibilities beyond their ability. A dashing and magnetic personality, appearing and disappearing with great suddenness, and leaving upheaval in his wake.
