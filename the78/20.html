<h2>Aeon</h2>
<p class="standard_M">Aeon

</p><p class="standard_Q">Aeon represents the great reunion that the ancients believed would happen once in every age. This was the time when souls are harvested and taken home to their place of origin. outside the solar system. Then the world is seeded with a batch of new souls and the process starts over.
From a modern point of view, this great reunion -- which includes every personality that you have ever been and every soul that you have done deep work with -- reunites to consciously complete the process. In a way, we symbolically celebrate this returning to center every year on our birthday.

In personal terms, this card points to freedom from inner conflicts, and so clear a channel, that the buried talents and gifts of past incarnations can come through an individual in this lifetime. This card counsels you to trust the process of opening yourself, because what emerges is of consistently high quality. You can effortlessly manifest as a multidimensional being, and assist in evoking that response from others.
