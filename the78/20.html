<h2>Aeon</h2>
<p class="standard_M">Rejuvenation.  Atonement. The need to repent and forgive. The moment to account for the manner in which we have used our opportunities. Rebirth. Improvement. Development. Promotion. Effort that ends in just reward. The desire for immortality. Legal judgment. A swift and conclusive decision. The resolution of a matter long unanswered. A change in point of view, most frequently towards greater enlightenment. Final balancing of karma. You have gone deep within yourself to search for answers. You have found a new spiritual awareness or rebirth to consciousness. Your ego is capable of helping you now, instead of you being its slave. What felt like the end of your life is now seen as a creative connection with the archetypal world. You are rejuvenated by an eternal flame.
