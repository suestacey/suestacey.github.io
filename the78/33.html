<h2>2 of Cups</h2>
<p class="standard_M">The perfect harmony of union, in romance, friendship, or business. A deep and palpable connection radiating joy and contentment. A great concordance or pledge of fidelity. The joining of male and female interpreted in the broadest sense. The sanctification of the natural through that which exists on a higher plane. May indicate the meeting of a kindred soul, marriage, engagement, merger, or partnership.

<p class="standard_MGrayHead">Reverse
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">Instability in romance, friendship, or business. A deep infatuation that excludes existing friends. A false promise or premature commitment.The entanglement of male and female interpreted in the broadest sense. The profaning of the sacred through the introduction of base desire. Folly, depletion, and waste. May suggest conflict, divorce, or a severing of ties. Failure to recognize a paradoxical situation at hand. Inability to confront emotional choices. Lack of harmony between different kinds of energies. Complimentary opposites remaining apart. Inability to transcend differences. Unnecessary haggling where exchanges for mutual benefit could be had. In the creative process, use the presence of contrary elements as an impetus for unleashing your imagination to exploit the inherent possibilities.
