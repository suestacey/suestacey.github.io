<h2>5 of Wands</h2>
<p class="standard_M">5 of Wands

</p><p class="standard_M">An intense struggle motivated purely by the love of competition. A state of seeming chaos driven by endless small disputes and complications. A hotly contested race, debate, game, or other challenge. A stressful situation that brings out the best in the participants.   A need for self-improvement. Struggling with inner demons, such as issues of conscience. Falling into disillusionment, or the dark side of the matter. Competition, arguments, power struggles. Getting thrown for a loop.
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayHead">Reverse
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">Pointless struggles motivated by the vain pursuit of recognition, financial reward, or base desires. Disunity, chaos, and petty quarreling at a time of crisis. A stressful situation that brings out the worst in the participants.
