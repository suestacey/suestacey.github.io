<h2>Justice</h2>
<p class="standard_M">Maintaining the perfection represented by the ideal causes stagnation. Balance lies in the harmonious union of opposing forces. Spiritual insight develops from the will to adapt to inevitable fluctuations. The achievement of balance and inner harmony after a great trial. Agreements, contracts, or treaties concluded justly. Things set to rights. Karma restored. A turn for the better in legal matters.
