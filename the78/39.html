Apprehensions about the unknown. Paranoia. Feelings of missing out on something. Former values and friends no longer interest you. Wanting to escape the situation.

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">Freedom from disappointment and dissatisfaction. The release of repressed emotions and distress. Being unphased by circumstances. Emotional stability in the face of challenge. Serenity. In the creative process: Psychodrama and emotional torments can serve as imaginative stimulants. Expressing and documenting what you feel can be artful as well as healing. The realization that a matter thought to be important was actually of little consequence. Moving on from something in which you had invested great love and devotion. The start of an inner journey to find higher aspects of life. Reflecting on what is truly fulfilling in life.
