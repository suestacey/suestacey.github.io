<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">Freedom from disappointment and dissatisfaction. The release of repressed emotions and distress. Being unphased by circumstances. Emotional stability in the face of challenge. Serenity. In the creative process: Psychodrama and emotional torments can serve as imaginative stimulants. Expressing and documenting what you feel can be artful as well as healing.
