<h2>Strength</h2>
<p class="standard_M">Your strength comes from many sources. You have mastered your emotional nature, your intellect has been honed. By making friends with your unconscious urges, you have allowed a freer flow of spirit. You feel as though you know the thoughts of people around you before they speak them. Mental and emotional health pervade your being in this moment. You grasp the sheer joy of your independence and your connection to others.
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayHead">Reverse
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">Weakness in the face of obstacles and adversity. Tremendous power released at the wrong moment. Inability to defend oneself. Confusion, and lack of preparedness. Illness, hardship, distress and the failing of physical force. Dominant behavior, abusiveness and a possible loss of reputation.
