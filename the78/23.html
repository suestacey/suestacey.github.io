<h2>Two of Wands</h2>
<p class="standard_M">Established power and influence over others. Strong will. The power of spiritual truth. Setting goals and a vision for the future. Coming to grips with the impact of past decisions, considering the current state of affairs, and developing a plan of action. Responsible leadership. All possibilities and potentials are yours for the taking if you just leap. Seize the opportunity. A decisive, perhaps early, accomplishment. Confirmation of boldness and courage.
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayHead">Reverse
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">The erosion of power and influence. Failing to articulate goals or establish a vision for the future. Being caught off guard, due to an inability to come to grips with the impact of past decisions. Obstinate and irresponsible leadership. Loss of interest, clarity, or faith in a venture.
