<h2>6 of Cups</h2>
<p class="standard_M">
Opening your heart to the simple pleasures of life. Fond memories fuel the playful embrace of love and life. Experiencing the joy of youth and sexual innocence. Engaging in acts of gentle kindness. Harmony of natural forces without effort or strain. Meeting an old friend.

</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayHead">Reverse
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">Clinging to the past and finding it difficult to move on. A hard time being in the present moment due to past baggage. Let go of old stories, and be open to new possibilities. Idyllic situation thus perhaps not realistic.
