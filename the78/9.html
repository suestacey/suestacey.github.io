<h2>Crone</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A murky situation requires wisdom and prudence. Allow your beliefs and convictions to guide you through the door of perception. Use your imagination to illuminate the unknown. Finding an answer or solution through introspection. Putting your own light and wisdom into action. Evoking the divine imagination as a transformative force in your own life.  Withdrawal from events and relationships to introspect and gather strength. Seeking the inner voice or calling upon vision from within. A need for understanding and advice, or a wise elder who will offer knowing guidance. Personal experience and thoughtful temperance. 
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayHead">Reverse
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">Detachment based on fear, irresponsibility or naivete. Self-imposed isolation from friends and loved ones. Listening to the wrong advice or ignoring good counsel. Concealment, disguise, and unreasoned caution.
