<h2>Crone</h2>
<p class="standard_M">Wisdom beyond the pale. A murky situation requires wisdom and prudence. Allow your beliefs and convictions to guide you through the door of perception. Use your imagination to illuminate the unknown. Finding an answer or solution through introspection. Putting your own light and wisdom into action. Evoking the divine imagination as a transformative force in your own life. 
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayHead">Reverse
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">Detachment based on fear, irresponsibility or naivete. Self-imposed isolation from friends and loved ones. Listening to the wrong advice or ignoring good counsel. Concealment, disguise, and unreasoned caution.
