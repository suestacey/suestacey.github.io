<h2>Daughter of Cups</h2>
<p class="standard_M"> A studious and intent person. Reflective, meditative and loyal person. Willingness to offer services and efforts toward a specific goal. A helpful person. A trustworthy worker.
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayHead">Reverse
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">An unexpected new relationship that is childish and foolish. An idle dreamer oblivious to the realities of the world. Moodiness, sad reflection, and retreat from society. Seduction and deception in personal and business relationships. Deviation. Susceptibility. Temporary distraction.  A flatterer.
