<h2>Ace of Discs</h2>
<p class="standard_M">Ace of Discs

</p><p class="standard_Q">Perfection. Attainment. Prosperity. Felicity. Bliss. Gold. Valuable coins or artifacts. Treasures. The combination of material and spiritual riches.  A tangible impetus to  creative action. Generating new forms. Putting your plan into action. New projects and works. A provocative opening. Powerful elements of sensuality and sexuality coming into play. Focus on fertility and virility. In the creative process: This is when you tap into the elemental and generative forces of life, using your inner vision to create new and exciting forms with which to work.  The seed of prosperity and material gain - perhaps as yet unseen. A new foundation from which to turn your dreams into reality. The need to focus on the practical and understand the dynamics of the natural world. May represent a gift, document, inheritance, or an unexpected opportunity for physical advancement.
