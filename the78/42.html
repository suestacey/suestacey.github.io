<h2>Ace of Discs</h2>
<p class="standard_M">Perfection. Attainment. Prosperity. Felicity. Bliss. Gold. Valuable coins or artifacts. Treasures. The combination of material and spiritual riches.  A tangible impetus to  creative action. Generating new forms. Putting your plan into action. New projects and works. A provocative opening. Powerful elements of sensuality and sexuality coming into play. Focus on fertility and virility. This is when you tap into the elemental and generative forces of life, using your inner vision to create new and exciting forms with which to work.  The seed of prosperity and material gain. A new foundation from which to turn your dreams into reality. The need to focus on the practical and understand the dynamics of the natural world. An unexpected gift, document, inheritance. Some surprising something-something in physical form.
