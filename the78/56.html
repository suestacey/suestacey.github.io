<h2>5 of Swords</h2>
<p class="standard_M"> An urging to consider the consequences of instant gratification. A success earned through personal degradation. Separation from friends brought about by an unfeeling and coldly calculated act. Temporary victory tainted by dishonor and providing fuel for eventual defeat. Difficulty in communicating your ideas to others. Thinking is fragmented and decisions are difficult, bringing confusion and doubt. Others try to impose their ideas on you, but you must rely on your own inner voice. Your thinking is so rigid that there is no room for other opinions.
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayHead">Reverse
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">Refusing to achieve success through personal degradation. Friendship maintained through the abandonment of a dishonorable gain. Slander and infamy avoided.
