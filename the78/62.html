<h2>Daughter of Wands</h2>
<p class="standard_M">The surprising appearance of a new passion. An adventurer who blazes through life, acting as a catalyst that others may harness. The intense enthusiasm and childlike imagination that fuels any new venture, needing only the application of mind and material to make it a success. Inner fire that can drive away fear and replace it with fury. Can represent a person of some timidity, but whose innate passion can be easily ignited. May indicate the birth of a child.

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">The surprising appearance of a new passion or inflammatory news. A trickster who can unexpectedly ignite a dangerous situation. The intensity and childish imagination that can send even the most stable venture spinning wildly out of control. Can represent a person outwardly timid, but harboring unexpected inner fury. May indicate the birth of a child. An unstable, indecisive and perhaps malicious person. A heartbreaker, gossiper, or bringer of bad news.
