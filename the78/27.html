<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">ï»¿A lack of success, failure, or a temporary setback where your efforts aren't recognized or rewarded as you'd hoped. It can also point to a need to stop relying on external validation and instead look inward for self-confidence. It might suggest you are ignoring problems and creating false victories by pretending things are copacetic. The card serves as a reminder to stay resilient, stay true to yourself, and consider a new approach to your goals. A marred reputation or a lack of recognition for accomplishments may be blocking the success that is deserved. If you are shying away from public attention and hiding your gifts from the world, you may be energetically blocking a positive outcome in your situation.
