<h2>7 of Cups</h2>
<p class="standard_M">
Daydreams and things seen in the glass of contemplation. The scattering of energies by strong desires and unrealistic goals. The pursuit of illusions and the dissipation of energy on false choices. Intoxication, delirium, and hallucination, leading to the negation of effort. Under rare and extreme circumstances, may indicate the revelation of transcendental spiritual truth. 
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayHead">Reverse
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">A retreat into fantasy. Emotional confusion or indecision. Overwhelmed by contradictory feelings. Delusions. Temptations or bribes. Illusory goals. Challenges of immediate versus long-term gratification. In the creative process: Let your visions and dreams lead the way into deeper realms of your imagination, and be prepared to express them. Rehearse and explore wild ideas in your mind before acting on them.
