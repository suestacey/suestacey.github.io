<h2>Son of Discs</h2>
<p class="standard_M">One slow to action, but decisive and unrelenting once set in motion. A force of nature whose methods are as predictable and dependable as they are unstoppable. The voice of duty, honor, and responsibility. The will to change the world, not through bold action, but through the thorough and unwavering application of proven means.

<p class="standard_MGrayHead">Reverse

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">
One slow to action, even in the most urgent circumstances. A force of nature that cannot be diverted from the wrong path. The voice of duty and honor, utterly divorced from reality. Lack of imagination and the complete unwillingness to try a different approach, even in the face of complete failure. Idleness and stagnation.
