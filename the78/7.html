<h2>Chariot</h2>
<p class="standard_M">Chariot

</p><p class="standard_Q">The Chariot Tarot card points to a triumphal feeling of freedom, as if the Charioteer is being paraded through the streets as a  heroine. Congratulations for high achievement, which serves as a sign of empowerment. Huge wheels and frisky steeds speed the rate at which the driver's will power can be realized. This kind of charge makes more of the world accessible to one ambitious enough to seize The Chariot's reins. But there is danger in this feeling of freedom, because of the increased rate of change and its power to magnify mistakes in judgment. As a seasoned warrior, the Charioteer is called upon to be extra attentive to the way ahead.


Reverse


When this card is reversed, it suggests that you may balk when you know you need to pick up the reins and take responsibility for setting your life in motion.  You know you could instigate change, but you haven't yet chosen to move toward it. You may be holding back for what feels like good reasons, but nothing is actually being imposed upon you; you do have other options. Own your own inner resistance instead of blaming circumstances.
