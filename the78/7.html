<h2>Chariot</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A triumphal feeling of freedom. Being paraded through the streets as a  heroine. Congratulations for high achievement, which serves as a sign of empowerment. Huge wheels and frisky steeds speed the rate at which the driver's will power can be realized. This kind of charge makes more of the world accessible to one ambitious enough to seize the reins. But there is danger in this feeling of freedom, because of the increased rate of change and its power to magnify mistakes in judgment. Be extra attentive to the way ahead. Victory through might. Advancement through bold action. Change through force. Order established through vigilance. A trying situation mastered by balancing opposing forces against each other. Discipline, individual effort and endurance will turn the tide.

<p class="standard_MGrayHead">Reverse
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">When this card is reversed, it suggests that you may balk when you know you need to pick up the reins and take responsibility for setting your life in motion.  You know you could instigate change, but you haven't yet chosen to move toward it. You may be holding back for what feels like good reasons, but nothing is actually being imposed upon you; you do have other options. Own your own inner resistance instead of blaming circumstances. To be unsuccessful. Defeat. Failure. At the last minute to lose something otherwise within grasp. Sudden collapse of plans. Vanquishment.
