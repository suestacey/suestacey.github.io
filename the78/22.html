<h2>Ace of Wands</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A new beginning and all the potential that comes with this new venture. Pursue that new path or project you've felt passionately about but haven't acted on yet. Use this time to take your first steps toward manifesting this goal. There's no need to make huge leaps forward, even a small step forward is still a step toward your success.
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayHead">Reverse
</p>

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">The seed of a new crisis - perhaps as yet unseen. The start of an explosive situation threatening to consume all who get too close. The herald of birth, invention, or upheaval. An innate and primal force unleashed. May suggest a surge of vitality, creativity, or fertility that can set dangerous events in motion.
