<h2>Star</h2>
<p class="standard_M">You are so closely tuned to the earth that you feel the cyclical wave of positive energy as it comes toward you. This is how you engage in a sort of participatory creation of lucky moments. The Star lights your path in a very direct way. You are aware of cycles and patterns around you and you respond to them freely and easily. Awareness of the pattern is your direct connection to the source.  Renewal of hope. Feeling connected with cosmic or universal energies. As Above, So Below. Opening your eyes to the highest potential of your situation. Getting in touch with your own creative powers. Self-esteem. Far-reaching effects. Receiving recognition for your abilities. Doing your own thing, no matter what.

<p class="standard_MGrayBlurb">
Lost hopes, doubt and failure. Physical health and mental outlook lost in the outer darkness. Desperation leading to blind faith in false solutions. Fears for the future. Isolation. Tension or anxiety. Hope.
