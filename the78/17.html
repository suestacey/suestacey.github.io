<h2>Star</h2>
<p class="standard_M">You are so closely tuned to the earth that you feel the cyclical wave of positive energy as it comes toward you. This is how you engage in a sort of participatory creation of lucky moments. The Star lights your path in a very direct way. You are aware of cycles and patterns around you and you respond to them freely and easily. Awareness of the pattern is your direct connection to the source.
