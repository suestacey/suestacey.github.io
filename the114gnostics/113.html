<h2>113</h2>
<p class="standard_M">His disciples said to him, "When will the kingdom come?"

</p><p class="standard_MP">He said, "It will not come by waiting for it. It will not be a matter of saying 'here it is' or 'there it is'. Rather the kingdom of the father is spread out upon the carth, and men do not see it."
