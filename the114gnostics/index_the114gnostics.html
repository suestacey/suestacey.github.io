<h2>The 114 Gnostics</h2>

<p class="red_highlight">1 Whoever finds the interpretation of these sayings will not experience death.</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">2 Let she who seeks continue seeking until she finds. When she finds she will become troubled. When she becomes troubled, she will be astonished, and she will rule over the all.</p>
<p class="red_highlight">3 If those who lead you say to you, 'See, the kingdom is in the sky,' then the birds of the air will precede you. If they say to you, 'It is in the sea,' then the fish will precede you. Rather, the kingdom is inside of you, and it is outside of you. When you come to know yourselves, then you will become known, and you will realize that it is you who are the children of the living one. But if you will not know yourselves, you dwell in poverty and it is you who are that poverty.</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">4 The self, old in days, will not hesitate to ask a small child of seven days old about the place of life, and she will live. For many who are first will become last, and they will become one and the same.</p>
<p class="red_highlight">5 Recognize what is in your sight, and that which is hidden from you will become plain to you. For there is nothing hidden which will not become manifest.</p>

<p class="red_highlight">7 He said, "Blessed is the lion which becomes woman when consumed by woman, and cursed is the womman whom the lion consumes, and the lion becomes woman.'</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">8 And he said, "The man is like a wise fisherman who cast his net into the sea and drew it up from the sea full of small fish. Among them the wise fisherman found a fine large fish. He threw all of the small fish back into the sea and chose the large fish without difficulty. Whoever has ears to hear, let bim bear."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">9 He said, "The man is like a wise fisherman who cast his net into the sea and drew it up from the sea full of small fish. Among them the wise fisherman found a fine large fish. He threw all of the small fish back into the sea and chose the large fish without difficulty. Whoever has ears to hear, let bim bear."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">10 He said, "I have cast fire upon the world, and see, I am guarding it until it blazes."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">11 He said, "This heaven will pass away, and the one above it will pass away. The dead are not alive, and the living will not die. In the days when you consumed what is dead, you made it what is alive. Wben you come to dwell in the light, what will you do On the day when you were one you became two. But when you become two, what will you do?"</p>

<p class="purple_highlight">14 He said to them, "If you fast, you will give rise to sin for yourself, and if you pray, you will be condemned, and if you give alms, you will do harm to your spirits. When you go into any land and walk about in the districts, if they receive you, eat what they will set before you, and heal the sick among them. For what goes into your mouth will not defile you, but that which issues from your mouth it is that which will defile you."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">15 He said, "When you see one who was not born of woman, prostrate yourselves on your faces and worship him. That one is your father."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">16 He said, "Men think, perhaps, that it is peace which I have come to cast upon the world. They do not know that it is dissension which I have come to cast upon the earth fire, sword and war. For there will be five in a house: three will be against two, and two against three, the father against the son, and the son against the father. And they will stand solitary."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">17 He said, "I shall give you what no eye has seen and what no ear has heard and what no hand has touched and what has never occurred to the human mind."</p>
<a href="18.html"><p class="purple_highlight">18</p></a>
<p class="red_highlight">19 He said, "Blessed is she who came into being before she came into being. If you become my disciples and listen to my words, these stones will minister to you. For there are five trees for you in Paradise which remain undisturbed summer and winter and whose leaves do not fall. Whoever becomes acquainted with them will not experience death."</p>
