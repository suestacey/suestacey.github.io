<h2>The 114 Gnostics</h2>

<p class="red_highlight">1 Whoever finds the interpretation of these sayings will not experience death.</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">2 Let she who seeks continue seeking until she finds. When she finds she will become troubled. When she becomes troubled, she will be astonished, and she will rule over the all.</p>
<p class="red_highlight">3 If those who lead you say to you, 'See, the kingdom is in the sky,' then the birds of the air will precede you. If they say to you, 'It is in the sea,' then the fish will precede you. Rather, the kingdom is inside of you, and it is outside of you. When you come to know yourselves, then you will become known, and you will realize that it is you who are the children of the living one. But if you will not know yourselves, you dwell in poverty and it is you who are that poverty.</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">4 The self, old in days, will not hesitate to ask a small child of seven days old about the place of life, and she will live. For many who are first will become last, and they will become one and the same.</p>
<p class="red_highlight">5 Recognize what is in your sight, and that which is hidden from you will become plain to you. For there is nothing hidden which will not become manifest.</p>

<p class="red_highlight">7 He said, "Blessed is the lion which becomes woman when consumed by woman, and cursed is the womman whom the lion consumes, and the lion becomes woman.'</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">8 And he said, "The man is like a wise fisherman who cast his net into the sea and drew it up from the sea full of small fish. Among them the wise fisherman found a fine large fish. He threw all of the small fish back into the sea and chose the large fish without difficulty. Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">9 He said, "The man is like a wise fisherman who cast his net into the sea and drew it up from the sea full of small fish. Among them the wise fisherman found a fine large fish. He threw all of the small fish back into the sea and chose the large fish without difficulty. Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">10 He said, "I have cast fire upon the world, and see, I am guarding it until it blazes."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">11 He said, "This heaven will pass away, and the one above it will pass away. The dead are not alive, and the living will not die. In the days when you consumed what is dead, you made it what is alive. Wben you come to dwell in the light, what will you do On the day when you were one you became two. But when you become two, what will you do?"</p>

<a href="13.html"><p class="red_highlight">13</p></a>
<p class="purple_highlight">14 He said to them, "If you fast, you will give rise to sin for yourself, and if you pray, you will be condemned, and if you give alms, you will do harm to your spirits. When you go into any land and walk about in the districts, if they receive you, eat what they will set before you, and heal the sick among them. For what goes into your mouth will not defile you, but that which issues from your mouth it is that which will defile you."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">15 He said, "When you see one who was not born of woman, prostrate yourselves on your faces and worship him. That one is your father."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">16 He said, "Men think, perhaps, that it is peace which I have come to cast upon the world. They do not know that it is dissension which I have come to cast upon the earth fire, sword and war. For there will be five in a house: three will be against two, and two against three, the father against the son, and the son against the father. And they will stand solitary."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">17 He said, "I shall give you what no eye has seen and what no ear has heard and what no hand has touched and what has never occurred to the human mind."</p>
<a href="18.html"><p class="purple_highlight">18</p></a>
<p class="red_highlight">19 He said, "Blessed is she who came into being before she came into being. If you become my disciples and listen to my words, these stones will minister to you. For there are five trees for you in Paradise which remain undisturbed summer and winter and whose leaves do not fall. Whoever becomes acquainted with them will not experience death."</p>

<a href="21.html"><p class="red_highlight">21</p></a>
<a href="22.html"><p class="purple_highlight">22</p></a>

<a href="24.html"><p class="purple_highlight">24</p></a>
<p class="red_highlight">25 He said, "Love your brother like your soul, guard him like the pupil of your eye."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">26 He said, "You see the mote in your brother's eye, but you do not see the beam in your own eye. When you cast the beam out of your own eye, then you will see clearly to cast the mote from your brother's eye."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">27 He said, "If you do not fast as regards the world, you will not find the kingdom. If you do not observe the Sabbath as a Sabbath, you will not see the father."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">28 He said, "I took my place in the midst of the world, and I appeared to them in flesh. I found all of them intoxicated, I found none of them thirsty. And my soul became afflicted for the sons of men, because they are blind in their hearts and do not have sight, for empty they came into the world, and empty too they seek to leave the world. But for the moment they are intoxicated. When they shake off their wine, then they will repent."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">29 He said, "If the flesh came into being because of spirit, it is a wonder. But if spirit came into being because of the body, it is a wonder of wonders. Indeed, I am amazed at bow this great wealth has made its home in this poverty."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">30 He said, "Where there are three gods, they are gods. Where there are two or one, I am with her.</p>
<p class="red_highlight">31 He said, "No prophet is accepted in her own village, no physician heals those who know her."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">32 He said, "A city being built on a high mountain and fortified cannot fall, nor can it be hidden."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">33 He said, "Preach from your bousetops that which you will hear in your ear. For no one lights a lamp and puts it under a bushel, nor does she put it in a hidden place, but rather she sets it on a lampstand so that everyone who enters and leaves can see its light."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">34 He said, "If a blind man leads a blind man, they will both fall into a pit."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">35 He said, "It is not possible for anyone to enter the house of a strong man and take it by force unless he binds his hands, then he will (be able to) ransack his house."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">36 He said, "Do not be concerned from morning until evening and from evening until morning about what you will wear."</p>
<a href="37.html"><p class="red_highlight">37</p></a>
<p class="purple_highlight">38 He said, "Many times you have desired to hear these words which I am saying to you, you have no one else to hear them from. There will be days when you will look for me and will not find me."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">39 He said, "The pharisees and scribes have taken the keys of knowledge (gnosis) and hidden them. They themselves have not entered, nor have they allowed to enter those who wish to. You, however, be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">40 He said, "A grapevine has been planted outside of the father, but being unsound, it will be pulled up by its roots and destroyed."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">41 He said, "Whoever has something in her band will receive more, and whoever has nothing will be deprived of even the little she has."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">42 He said, "Become passers-by."</p>
<a href="43.html"><p class="red_highlight">43</p></a>
<p class="purple_highlight">44 He said, "Whoever blasphemes against the father will be forgiven, and whoever blasphemes against the son will be forgiven, but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will not be forgiven either on earth or in heaven."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">45 He said, "Grapes are not harvested from thorns, nor are figs gathered from thistles, for they do not produce fruit. A good man brings forth good from his storehouse, an evil man brings forth evil things from his evil storehouse, which is in their heart, and says evil things. For out of the abundance of the heart be brings forth evil things."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">46 He said, "Among those born of women, from Adam until John the Baptist, there is no one superior to John the Baptist that big eyes should not be lowered before him). Yet I have said, whichever one of you comes to be a child will be acquainted with the kingdom and will become superior to John."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">47 He said, "It is impossible for a man to mount two horses or to stretch two bows. And it is impossible for a servant to serve two masters, otherwise, be will honor the one and treat the other contemptuously. No man drinks old wine and immediately desires to drink new wine. And new wine is not put into old wineskins, lest they burst, nor is old wine put into a new wineskin, lest it spoil it. An old patch is not sewn into a new garment, because a tear would result."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">48 said, "If two make peace with each other in this one house, they will say to the mountain, 'Move away,' and it will move away."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">49 He said, "Blessed are the solitary and elect, for you will find the kingdom. For you are from it, and to it you will return."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">50 He said, "If they say to you, 'Where did you come from?' say to them, 'We came from the light, the place where the light came into being on its own accord and established [itself] and became manifest through their image.' If they say to you, 'Is it you?' say, 'We are its children, we are the elect of the living father.' If they ask you, 'What is the sign of the father in you?' say to them, 'It is movement and repose.' "</p>

<a href="52.html"><p class="purple_highlight">52</p></a>
<a href="53.html"><p class="red_highlight">53</p></a>
<p class="purple_highlight">54 He said, "Blessed are the poor, for yours is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="red_highlight">55 He said, "Whoever does not hate his father and his mother cannot become a disciple to me. And whoever does not hate his brothers and sisters and take up his cross in my way will not be worthy of me."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">56 He said, "Whoever has come to understand the world base found (only) a corpse, and shower bas found a corpse is superior to the world."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">57 He said, " The kingdom of the father is like a man who had [good] seed. His enemy came by night and sowed weeds among the good seed. The man did not allow them to pull up the weeds, he said to them, I am afraid that you will go intending to pull up the weeds and pull up the wheat along with them.' For on the day of the harvest the weeds will be plainly visible, and they will be pulled up and burned."</p>

<a href="60.html"><p class="purple_highlight">60</p></a>
<a href="61.html"><p class="red_highlight">61</p></a>
<p class="purple_highlight">62 He said, "It is to those [who are worthy of my] mysteries that I tell my mysteries. Do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">63 He said, "There was a rich man who had much money. He said, 'I shall put my money to use so that I may sow, reap, plant and fill my storehouse with produce, with the result that I shall lack nothing.' Such were his intentions, but that same night he died. Let one who has ears hear."</p>
<a href="64.html"><p class="purple_highlight">64</p></a>
<p class="red_highlight">65 He said, "There was a good man who owned a vineyard. He leased it to tenant farmers so that they might work it and he might collect the produce from them. He sent his servant so that the tenants might give him the produce of the vineyard. They seized his servant and beat him, all but killing him. The servant went back and told his master. The master said, 'Perhaps they did not recognize him.' He sent another servant. The tenants beat this one as well. Then the owner sent his son and said, 'Perhaps they will show respect for my son. Because the tenants knew that it was he who was the heir to the vineyard, they seized him and killed him. Let him who has ears hear."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">66 He said, "Show me the stone which the builders have rejected. That one is the cornerstone."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">67 He said, "If one who knows the all still feels a personal deficiency, that person, he is completely deficient."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">68 He said, "Blessed are you when you are hated and persecuted. Wherever you have been persecuted they will find no place.</p>
<p class="red_highlight">69 He said, "Blessed are they who have been persecuted within themselves. It is they who have truly come to know the Father. Blessed are the hungry, for the belly of her who desires will be filled."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">70 He said, "That which you have will save you if you bring it forth from yourselves. That which you do not have within you will [kill] you if you do not have it within you.</p>
<p class="red_highlight">71 He said, "I shall [destroy this] house, and no one will be able to build it [...]"</p>
<a href="72.html"><p class="purple_highlight">72</p></a>
<p class="red_highlight">73 He said, "The harvest is great but the laborers are few. Beseech the Lord, therefore, to send out laborers to the harvest."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">74 He said, "O Lord, there are many around the drinking trough, but there is nothing in the cistern."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">75 He said, "Many are standing at the door, but it is the solitary and elect who will enter the bridal chamber."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">76 He said, "The kingdom of the Father is like a merchant who had a consignment of merchandise and who discovered a pearl. That merchant was shrewd. He sold the merchandise and bought the pearl alone for himself. You, too, seek his unfailing and enduring treasure where no moth comes near to devour and no worm destroys."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">77 He said, "It is I who am the Light which is above them all. It is I who am the all. From me did the all come forth, and unto me did the all extend. Split a piece of wood, and I am there. Lift up the stone, and you will find me there."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">78 He said, "Why have you gone out into the desert? To see a reed shaken by the wind? And to see a man clothed in fine garments (like your) kings and your great men? Upon them are fine garments, and they are unable to discern the truth."</p>
<a href="79.html"><p class="red_highlight">79</p></a>

<p class="purple_highlight">82 He said, "He who is near me is near the fire, and he who is far from me is far from the kingdom."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">83 He said, "The images are manifest to man, but the light in them remains concealed in the image of the light of the father. He will become manifest, but his image will remain concealed by his light."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">84 He said, "When you see your likeness, you rejoice. But when you see your images which came into being before you, and which neither die nor become manifest, how much will you have to bear!"</p>
<p class="red_highlight">85 He said, "Adam came into being from a great power and a great wealth, but he did not become worthy of you. For had be been worthy, [he would] not [have experienced] death."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">86 He said, "[The foxes have their holes] and the birds have their nests, but the son of man has no place to lay his head and rest."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">87 He said, "Wretched is the body that is dependent upon a body, and wretched is the soul that is dependent upon these two."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">88 He said, "The angels and the prophets will come to you and give you those things you (already) have. And you too, give them those things which you have, and say to yourselves, 'When will they come and take what is theirs?' "</p>

<p class="red_highlight">95 [He said], "If you have money, do not lend it at interest, but give [it] to one from whom you will not get it back."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">96 He said, "The kingdom of the Father is like [a certain] woman. She took a little leaven, [concealed] it in some dough, and made it into large loaves. Let him who has ears hear."</p>
<p class="red_highlight">97 He said, "The kingdom of the father] is like a certain woman who was carrying a [jar] full of meal. While she was walking (on the road), still some distance from home, the handle of the jar broke and the meal emptied out behind her (on) the road. She did not realize it, she had noticed no accident. When she reached her house she set the jar down and found it empty."</p>
<p class="purple_highlight">98 He said, "The kingdom of the father is like a certain man who wanted to kill a powerful man. In his own home he drew his sword and struck the wall in order to find out whether his hand could carry through. Then he slew the strong man."</p>
