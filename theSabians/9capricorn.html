<h2>9 Capricorn</h2>
<p class="standard_M">AN ANGEL WITH A LYRE, BACKDROPPED BY THE STARS, AND A WOMAN WALKING, RAPT-EYED, TOWARDS THE LIGHT

</p><p class="standard_Q">The Milky Way. Magnetic force as the root of eros. Deathless love and devotion. Following one's heart-strings (temptation of the sirens). Cosmic attunement. Blinding oneself to the mundane so as to better attune oneself to the divine (frustration with mundane obstacles). Revelation of personal, national, or cosmic destiny. Political or religious leadership. Drawing others into the harmony of one's vision. Charisma and glamor. Wonder.
