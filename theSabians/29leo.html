<h2>29 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">RADIANT MERMAID, CHAINED IN A CAVE BY THE SEA, AWAITING RESCUE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Extricating oneself from situations in which only part of one's nature can be expressed vs. unrealistically waiting for outside aid or deliverance. Surviving and moving beyond painful experiences. Submerging one's identity to protect oneself, vs. finding one's true voice (speaking from the heart). Liberating aspects of fantasy. Differentiating one's own desires from the desires of the collective (keeping hope alive through vicarious fulfilment). Drawing on spiritual reserves. Feeding starving aspects of the psyche with light from the inner realm. Escapist fantasy. Surrealistic visions. Revealing the dark underside of society's oppressions through art and literature. Inner freedom.
