<h2>26 Capricorn</h2>
<p class="standard_M">RADIANT SPRITE DANCES ON THE MISTS OF A WATERFALL

</p><p class="standard_Q">Refusing to get immersed in the flow of time-bound everyday events. Constant recollection of the ideal self. Delighting in the rapid flow of emotions and events, and mischievously redirecting them through timely interventions. Self-refreshment. The light touch. Hide and seek: eternal soul glimmering through the ephemerality of earthly forms. Immanence of the gods in men, and heaven in nature.
