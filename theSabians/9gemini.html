<h2>9 Gemini</h2>
<p class="standard_M">MEDIEVAL ARCHER, WITH POINTED BEARD AND FEATHERED HAT, TAKES AIM WITH A CROSSBOW

</p><p class="standard_Q">Vigilance. Alertness to danger signals in the environment. Keenly trained perceptions. Fealty. Robin Hood archetype: obeying the spirit of the law rather than the letter. Standing up for spiritual truths. Taking one's place in a chain of command. Rising through the ranks (going rogue). Political reformers who sometimes become revolutionaries. Forming new political or cultural groups. Working as a team. Agile maneuvers (dance). Zen-like unity of mind and body (hair-trigger nerves, high strung, schizzy). Seeing through complicated schemes to a person's underlying motives (playing one's own cards close to the chest). Pointed observations. Hitting the mark.
