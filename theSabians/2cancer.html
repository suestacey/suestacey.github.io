<h2>2 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">STAGE MAGICIAN IN A WHITE TUXEDO TAKES OFF ON A MAGIC CARPET, TO THE AMAZEMENT OF THE CHILDREN IN THE AUDIENCE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Confronting a mystery. Suspended judgment. Puzzling out an intricate problem. Following a line of evidence to get behind false appearances. Discovering hidden centers of control (devices; "Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain"). Finding a spot in the public imagination (fall out of favor). Resonating with and galvanizing the younger generation's way of seeing things (synchronicity; cosmic attunement; good timing). Maintaining the child's energetic playfulness and his sense of human possibilities vs. trying to live up to adult expectations. Multiple projects. Real-life hat tricks: creatively combining the elements or people in a situation into a beautiful and surprising new whole.
