<h2>19 Libra</h2>
<p class="standard_M">ROBBERS HIDING IN A STARLIT FOREST, READY TO ATTACK A CARAVAN LADEN WITH PRECIOUS CARGO

</p><p class="standard_Q">The endlessly unfolding wonder of the universe, which stops as soon as we try to seize on one particular moment. Magic. Promethean attempt to steal the divine fire (starlight). Ability to tap into people's thoughts (voyeurism). Entertaining alternate perspectives to see which leads to one's goal. Losing oneself to find oneself.
