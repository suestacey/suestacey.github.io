<h2>15 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A LOUD, COLORFUL MARDI GRAS PARADE SNAKES THROUGH CITY STREETS

</p><p class="standard_Q">Manifestation of the energies of the gods within the banal dramas of everyday life. Living out one's own myths. Creating a colorful public mask. Acting as the ringmaster of one's own reality. Projecting meaning into events. Seeing the sublime or the horrible within everyday life (entertaining distortions, as in a hall of mirrors). Seeing through phony appearances to a situation's underlying dynamics. Insightfully sizing up a situation. Reeling in an audience by giving them what they want (schlock culture). Participating in the parade of life (unending search for pleasure, and flight from fear, brushes with Mr. Death). Telling the real story vs. inventing tall tales.
