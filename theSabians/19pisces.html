<h2>19 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">SPIRITUAL LEADER, HOLDING A LIGHTED TORCH, PREACHES TO THE PEOPLE FROM ATOP A ROCKY CRAG

</p><p class="standard_Q">Spiritual leadership. Sense of divine mission. Setting things straight. Healing the sick. Lifting up the downtrodden. Composing disputes. Heart-felt plea for mutual understanding. Important messages for humanity. Helping others to rise above base behavior, petty squabbles, and crippling delusions. Long-term emotional commitments. Seeing the divine in others. Sense of being misunderstood or unappreciated. Sexual infidelity following upon spiritual infidelity. Keeping higher spiritual values in mind. Burning, purifying spiritual passion. Living in the light. Way-showers. Seeking one's reward in the completion of one's earthly task. Promethean connection to higher spiritual realms.
