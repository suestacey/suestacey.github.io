<h2>16 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A JESTER IN A CAP AND BELLS RECITES AN OBSCENE LIMERICK. THE KING SENDS HIM OFF TO THE DUNGEON.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Stratification of society into the empowered and the disempowered (society as a fortress or prison). Closing ranks within one's class or one's nation (tribalism and racism). Perpetual struggle between authoritarians and free spirits. Clamping down vs loosening up. Upholding the law vs subverting society's legitimacy through cheeky humor (blowing off steam). Poking holes in the official story. Fighting for the right to direct social energies. Rearguard defense of existing institutions vs. embracing a new stage of social evolution. Cutting edge culture. Uncensored truth meets the repressive tactics of uptight assholes. Trade-offs between social stability and individual freedom. Hip vs. square.
