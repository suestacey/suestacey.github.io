<h2>23 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">SCANTILY-DRESSED BAREBACK RIDER JUMPS INTO THE RING AMIDST ROWDY APPLAUSE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Taking center-stage. Enthusiastically showing off one's talents. Publicity-seeking. Generating energy and excitement. Getting things to revolve around oneself (egomania; testy and continual demand for respect). Occupying the center of a storm of public controversy. Outrageous behavior. Overstepping the accepted bounds of decorum, yet maintaining one's poise (burlesque, stand-up comedy). Catering to the appetites of the masses (loudmouthed vulgarity). Exploding social constructs through surrealistic parody. Calculating one's next move (coiled up and ready to spring into action). Worldliness. Sexual expressiveness. Taking control through force of personality. Theatricality.
