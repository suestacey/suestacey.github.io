<h2>20 Capricorn</h2>
<p class="standard_M">THE AISLE OF AN EMPTY CHURCH, WITH A ROW OF CLOSED DOORS ON ONE SIDE, A HIDDEN CHOIR IS HEARD

</p><p class="standard_Q">The maternal subconscious, that leads endlessly back in time. Regrets: the opportunities not taken, the songs not sung. Knowing how to escape negative situations or mind-sets. Escaping the entrapments of karma. Moving towards the light at the end of the tunnel. Emergence.
