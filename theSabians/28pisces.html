<h2>28 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A TROPICAL GARDEN UNDER THE FULL MOON. ARMS UPRAISED, THE HIGH PRIESTESS CHARMS A KING COBRA

</p><p class="standard_Q">Struggle to evolve. Rising above the dog-eat-dog world of brute nature. Circe: the power of sexuality to animalize or humanize people. Raising relationships from the level of dominance-submission games to a level of mutual respect (even on international lines). Getting "fucked" vs. standing up for one's rights. Being seduced vs. using seductiveness as a way of getting ahead (gold-diggers). Issues of loyalty and trust (falling into the coils of treachery, sycophancy or perversion). Universal life-energy which is the basis of sexual charisma, and which can be received through nature-worship. Reveling in the intoxicating beauty of nature. Imaginative power. Kundalini.
