<h2>26 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A KING CONTEMPLATES THE BATTLEFIELD BY THE LIGHT OF THE NEW MOON. MINISTERS OF DIFFERING TEMPERAMENTS GIVE HIM CONFLICTING ADVICE.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Cultural crossroads. Considering the consequences of possible courses of action. Quandaries and moments of decision. Bold carry through. Factoring in prejudices of station or temperament when listening to advice. Primacy of either rationality or emotion in every person. Reality as a discourse between right and left hemispheres of the brain. Having a dominant philosophy that determines what images one considers real vs. having strong emotional impressions that shape one's philosophical assumptions. Influencing culture by determining the topics and terms of discourse. Reexamining underlying assumptions and motivations. Getting behind external appearances vs. being caught off guard. Sturm und drang (dire situations). Penetrating insight.
