<h2>12 Taurus</h2>
<p class="standard_M">

</p><p class="standard_Q">Setting concrete goals and going after them (inflated expectations and demands). Evaluating what is worth owning or fighting for. Calculating cautiously vs. hastily capitalizing on opportunities for personal gain (piracy; colonialism). Simplifying one's short-term needs for long-term gains. Paying one's dues, but seizing the first real opportunity for advancement. Domination vs. subordination. Rebellion against arbitrary authority or the tyranny of false values. Issues of ownership. Territorial disputes (warmongering vs. pacifism). Reliance of authority on costume and demeanor (clothes make the man; pretenders to power). Cutting a figure. Showcasing one's best qualities.
