<h2>22 Capricorn</h2>
<p class="standard_M">DEFEATED GENERAL YIELDS UP HIS SWORD WITH NOBLE DIGNITY

</p><p class="standard_Q">Conquered pride. Accepting setbacks gracefully, without losing sight of long-range goals. Putting forth one's best effort regardless of victory or defeat. Rededication to ideals. Gamesmanship. Unemotional assessment of obstacles and adversaries (defeatism). Playing the situation as it lies.
