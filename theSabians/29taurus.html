<h2>29 Taurus</h2>
<p class="standard_M">TWO SHOEMAKERS ON A BENCH, ARGUING AS THEY WORK

</p><p class="standard_Q">Engaging others in honest dialogue. Driving home a point. Hitting the nail on the head (poor listeners; have to have the final word). Skillful, rational, point-for-point debate vs. yelling matches or ineffectual yammering. Biting one's tongue vs. lashing out (angry flailings). Drive to get through other people's insensitivity and make them see the light. Messianic intensity. Taking on life's basic existential questions (puncturing the inconsistencies of religious or political authorities). The straight and narrow. Standing on firm moral ground. Steadfast reliance on basic spiritual values. Being crucified by the truth. Bearing witness.
