<h2>16 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">CIRCLED BY DUSKY HYENAS, A GOLDEN-MANED LION GROWLS IN FEARLESS DEFIANCE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Taking on all comers. Standing up to an enemy vs. caving in. Proving oneself through courageous action. Rushing boldly into the breech (ferocity; temper). Making a forceful personal statement. Matter-of-factly laying out one's opinions. Righteous realignment to the life force vs. dallying with the forces of darkness (dishonorable alliances; unwholesome scenes). Spiritual cleansing. Exposing and purging what is unwholesome, unhealthy, or perverted. Vitalizing and lighting up one's environment. Hearty friendship. Eminence: rising above the crowd. Interrelationship of physical and spiritual health. Solar vitality. Spunk. Overflowing gratefulness for life. Passionate living. Vehemence.
