<h2>18 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A REVIVALIST, PREACHING INSIDE A HUGE TENT

</p><p class="standard_Q">The maverick. Constructing an independent world-picture. Pegging down broad theories with new facts. Focusing public attention on relevant issues. Framing new questions. Puncturing complacent assumptions. Working on some culturally noteworthy project, alone or with one other person. Rehearsals (going off half-cocked: easily deflated claims, but impervious to criticism). Getting one's act together and pitching it to the public. Seeing how it plays in public (refuse to revise what doesn't go over). Galvanizing oratory. Making converts. Using controversy as a draw. Finding the right medium for one's message. Ministering to public needs rather than public wants.
