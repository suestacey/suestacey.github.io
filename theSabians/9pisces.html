<h2>9 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">THE RACE BEGINS: A JOCKEY SPURS HIS HORSE TO GREAT SPEED

</p><p class="standard_Q">Unflinching purposiveness and resolve. Domination of will over desire. Bridling in one's impulses. Putting on mental blinders to avoid being side-tracked. Cavalier attitude towards life's ups and downs. Achieving mastery through training and practice. The exercise of  power: gauging how much force one needs to master the situation. Deft touch vs. heavy-handedness (subordinating the ends to the means: use of physical threats). Battles of  nerves: competition. Jockeying for position. Displacing others or being displaced. Maintaining one's national identity in a foreign country. Exile vs. pilgrimage. Fight or flight.
