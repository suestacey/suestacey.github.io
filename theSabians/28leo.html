<h2>28 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A TREE ATOP A HIGH MOUNTAIN, WITH COLONIES OF CHIRPING BIRDS NESTING AMONG ITS BRANCHES

</p><p class="standard_Q">Refounding society on the spiritual principles of friendship and cooperation rather than on money and power (unfazed by money matters, get by). Faith that the natural order will sustain a society built on natural laws. Giving one's ideals time to bear fruit (uncommitted; drop everything and move on). Refusing to buy into society's unconscious beliefs (nihilism; foil authoritarian agendas that block egalitarian visions). Exploiting forces of concord and discord. Dividing friend from foe. Raising a squawk vs. talking things out (idle chatter). Eventual realization of heaven or hell within the mind. Universalism in religion (each branch represents a different spiritual tradition; or, intolerant tribalism). Friendly approachability.
