<h2>14 Virgo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">AN EXTENSIVE FAMILY TREE ENGRAVED ON A SHEET OF PARCHMENT

</p><p class="standard_Q">Using and developing the inherited resources of one's family or one's social group. Looking after one's social ties and connections. Patching or reweaving the social fabric (meddlesome; bound by a sense of family duty). The tree of life--the interrelatedness of all life.
