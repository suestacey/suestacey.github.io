<h2>25 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">YOUNG ARAB MERCHANT, ON CAMEL, RIDES ACROSS THE DESERT TOWARDS THE RISING SUN

</p><p class="standard_Q">Resolved but flexible pursuit of long-range goals. Getting one's life together. Whipping oneself into line vs. letting some vice run away with you. Mobilizing one's vital energy. Wrangling with stubborn obstacles. Perseverance. Toughing it out when progress is barely visible vs. making great strides when conditions are favorable. Opening people's eyes to the Truth. Shaking them awake. Taking a firm stand on society's direction. Honest self-revelation vs. having secrets come to light. Physical or mental prowess vs. stumbling incompetence preceding mastery (comedy: playing the fool). Jettisoning excess baggage. Moving beyond past difficulties. Embarking on a new phase of life.
