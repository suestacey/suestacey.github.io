<h2>27 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A MELON PATCH UNDER A NEARLY-FULL MOON. A MAN FERTILIZES THE PLANTS AND PICKS THE FRUIT.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Introducing a cultural form that fills some popular appetite and thus "takes off". Reversals or blights following unrestrained growth. Developing a precocious talent. Feverish back-room preparations followed by the sudden appearance of finished products. Being clued-in to what's happening in powerful circles. Getting in on the ground floor (suspicion of powerful malignant forces at work; skulduggery). Keeping things under wraps vs. brutal exposure. Tuning in to spiritual energies (being inspired by astral energies vs. being possessed by them). Openness to the whole. Serene reflection on all the complex factors in a situation, intuitively recognizing what's missing. Inside sources.
