<h2>4 Capricorn</h2>
<p class="standard_M"> CROWDED INTO A LARGE BLACK CANOE, A COMMUNAL GROUP EMBARK DOWNRIVER, ON A NIGHT VOYAGE THROUGH ENEMY TERRITORY

</p><p class="standard_Q">Entering into foreign worlds and mind-sets (secret life of the demimonde). The lure of forbidden knowledge (Pandora's box). Doubting one's reality set. Pricking people's conscience, challenging their assumptions. Keeping a lid on unwholesome desires, or airing them out. Confidentiality:  speaking to the secret heart beyond the mask. The loyal heart which doesn't betray intimacies. Mysteries of Osiris. The closed carriage: not knowing exactly where one is.
