<h2>15 Scorpio</h2>
<p class="standard_M">LAUGHING CHILDREN PLAY ON FIVE MOUNDS OF WHITE SAND

</p><p class="standard_Q">The five senses. Carefree, guiltless, and playful sensuality. The world as the playground of the five senses. Sexual generosity. The need to touch and be touched. Firm grounding in the physical world.
