<h2>27 Aries</h2>
<p class="standard_M">CHINESE SAGE MEDITATES ON THE PRIMAL HEAVEN, WHICH EXISTED BEFORE ALL MANIFESTATION

</p><p class="standard_Q">Living life as a myth or dream. Withdrawing from life's activities in order to regain a full sense of life's possibilities. Forays into life and subsequent self-extrication (courting danger). Reclaiming misused knowledge or energy for the use of the higher self.
