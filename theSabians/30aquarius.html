<h2>30 Aquarius</h2>
<p class="standard_M">STRANGE WHITE FLOWERS GROWING AMIDST THE MOONLIT RUINS OF BABYLON

</p><p class="standard_Q">Self-extrication. Realization that society is corrupt and undependable, and that the individual must eventually stand on their own, no matter how strange they may be (will-less social conformity). Social alienation bridged by compassion. Decay, mutation, and reconstitution. Piecing together the wisdom of the past or zombie-like immersion in cultural garbage.
