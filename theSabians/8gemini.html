<h2>8 Gemini</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A PICKET LINE CIRCLES A SMOKE FILLED FACTORY. THE OWNER LOOKS OUT ON THE CROWD AND GRINDS HIS TEETH IN DEFIANCE.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Envisioning life as a struggle between good and evil. Having to choose sides. Polarization preceding a final battle. Enlisting in a cause (misplaced loyalties). Choosing a profession that serves as a platform for one's humanitarian ideals. Choosing one's masters wisely (suffer moral dilemmas in the workplace). Repetitive karmic situations that demand bravery or cause repeated humiliation (cowardly; talking out of both sides of one's mouth; false fronts; intrigue). Disengaging oneself from deadlocked situations. Finding a situation where one can make one's own rules (outlaws). Imaginative fiction: fantasy, gothic romance, horror. Internal struggle between two personality components: populist and aristocratic, cooperative and selfish.
