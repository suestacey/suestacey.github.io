<h2>3 Capricorn</h2>
<p class="standard_M">HOLDING A CANDLE IN FRONT OF HER FACE, A CHILD IN A NIGHTSHIRT RAPS LIGHTLY ON A SHUTTERED DOOR.

</p><p class="standard_Q">The pure flame of a child's love and its tendency to get suffocated by the disillusionment and corruption of advancing age. Guarding the flame (Vesta as ruler of Capricorn). Return of the light force from deep within (the winter solstice). Willingness to suffer and grow for the sake of love. Developing emotional confidence and trust, or hesitancy and impotence in reaching out to others. Sensitivity and gentleness (touchiness and emotional retaliation).
