<h2>29 Gemini</h2>
<p class="standard_M">THE FIRST MOCKINGBIRD OF SPRING SINGS FROM THE TREE TOP

</p><p class="standard_Q">Trying out a new idea to see if it has intuitive resonance. Prying deeper meanings from everyday events (overgeneralize from their experience). Incisive political or social humor. Odd but revealing new perspectives. Inserting one's opinion (meddlesome; argumentative needling). Quick sketches, skits, short stories. Pithy observations. Trying to untangle a knotty problem (perplexed). Offering simple solutions vs. needlessly adding complicating factors. Knowing how involved to get in a situation (flexibility vs. stubborn imposition of will). Instinctive shift of voice between the light and the heavy according to the social situation (feign social obliviousness so they can play by their own rules). Jocular familiarity. Signaling an alternate course. Cultural gadflys.
