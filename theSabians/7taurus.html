<h2>7 Taurus</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A BRASS URN AT HER FEET, MARY MAGDALENE WASHES HER FACE AT THE WELL

</p><p class="standard_Q">One's outer behavior reflects one's inner Divine nature or muddying the waters with murky passions (self-abandonment). Putting love and commitment into one's sexual  relations or wallowing in debasing sensation (perversion). Emotional reintegration. Atonement through service to humanity (brazening it out). Moral behavior, regular meditation, and physical health as prerequisites to higher spiritual understanding (doubters; learn only through experience). Seeing oneself as a vessel or servant of transpersonal truths. Inclusive love: showing that one cares about the whole of humanity. The common touch (vulgarity). Exoteric religion as a vessel to inner mysteries. Purification.
