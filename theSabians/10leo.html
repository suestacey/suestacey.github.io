<h2>10 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A WROUGHT-IRON GATEWAY OPENS TO AN ART DECO MANSION. ON THE LAWN, WHITE PEACOCKS STRUT WHILE CHILDREN PLAY WITH GOLDEN HOOPS.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Leaving tangible gifts for the future: legacies of wealth, cultural traditions, or idealistic children to carry forward the work. Building up a worldly estate in order to share it with others (hoarding wealth, living only for oneself, luxuriating in transient delights). Serving as an exemplar to one's children by acting out of an ideal self-image. Centering oneself in eternal spiritual forms rather than transient material forms (fortunes won and lost, winning the throne, then being deposed). Playing around like a child vs. reluctant activism: publicly promoting one's beliefs. Focusing on inner dreams and materializing them (emanationist mysticism). Inner aristocracy vs. empty display.
