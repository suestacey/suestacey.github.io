<h2>28 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">TWO CULTURALLY DIFFERENT COLLEGE STUDENTS GO ON A DATE TO MEET THE OTHERS' FAMILY

</p><p class="standard_Q">Power of the heart to bridge cultural differences. Breaking down national or racial barriers by refusing to respect or acknowledge them (hidden agendas, hostile takeovers, colonialism). Introducing a more modern and sophisticated consciousness to a traditionalist culture (having to imitate the behavior of the dominant culture to gain acceptance; pretense; tokenism). Being hip to what's going on beneath society's superficial cultural forms. Pushing a new cultural agenda. Humble yet confident bid for affection and understanding. Using a talent or skill to gain acceptance in an otherwise closed society (wowing the public). Letting down one's defenses. Speaking from the heart.
