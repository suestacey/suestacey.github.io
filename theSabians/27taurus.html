<h2>27 Taurus</h2>
<p class="standard_M">AN OLD INDIGENOUS WOMAN SELLING THE ARTIFACTS OF HER TRIBE TO PASSERS-BY

</p><p class="standard_Q">Looking oppression in the eye. Penetrating analysis of power relationships between individuals, between the individual and society, and between differing cultures. Determination to change the world (subtle subversion vs. open revolt). Fighting for human dignity and individual rights. Touchstones: recognizing friends and enemies by whether they receive an offered truth. Radicalism (extremists; intolerant ideologues). Good or bad effects depending on whether love or hate motivates one's work (talismans). Bemused view of human foibles. Loaded statements (warning rattles preceding full-fledged verbal attacks). Rejecting the tyranny of common assumptions. Eloquent protest. Calm wisdom that grows with age.
