<h2>20 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">ATOP A MESA CROWDED WITH CAMERA-TOTING TOURISTS, A SHAMAN PERFORMS A MAJESTIC RITUAL TO THE SUN

</p><p class="standard_Q">Guarding the spiritual integrity of society from cultural invaders vs. establishing one's spiritual legitimacy in foreign territory (moving with authority and power; taking pride in one's cultural roots; secret powwows aimed at usurping power). Penetrating to the occult foundation of cultural forms vs. ignorant borrowing of fetishy power objects. Making cosmic processes humanly understandable through ritual and dance. Reenacting the cardinal principles of a spiritual tradition. Inwardly holding to an older spiritual tradition but projecting a modern face to the world. Unbroken concentration. Being called upon to act as a priest or priestess. Finding one's power spot.
