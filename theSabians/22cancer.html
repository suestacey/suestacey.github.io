<h2>22 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">BY THE STAR-LIT SEA, A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AWAITS A SAILBOAT'S APPROACH

</p><p class="standard_Q">Drawing down the beauty, magic, and romance of the inner world. Desire to fall in love and make dreams into realities. Playing into other people's desires (promising more than one can deliver). Looking to other people to fulfill one's desires (differentiating energy takers from energy givers; con artists and sirens from priestesses and shamans). Energy trades (beauty = money = power = status). Shakti/Isis as the mistress of the Gods. The Moon's role in channeling and personalizing planetary energies according to changing needs (unfulfilled; hungry for adventure and life). Worshipful visualization as a way of drawing down divine energies. Dangerous Homeric voyages. Following one's own muses.
