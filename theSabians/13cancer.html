<h2>13 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A TRAVELER OFFERS HIS HAND TO A STRANGER IN A GESTURE OF GOOD WILL (A HAND WITH A PROMINENT THUMB)

</p><p class="standard_Q">Quick friendships and alliances made on the road. Open society of the good at heart. Developing a will and identity independent of one's family and one's native culture. Willful independence of judgment. Extending one's grasp of life by extending the range of one's experience. Cross-cultural comparisons (over-generalize from limited experience; naive). Extending small-town values to the wider community. Neighborliness, lending a hand (glad-handing; wavering commitment). Boldly striking out on some new course despite local nay-saying. Retaining one's love of humanity despite bad experiences. Spiritual shepherding:  gathering together people of a sympathetic nature. Open-handed generosity.
