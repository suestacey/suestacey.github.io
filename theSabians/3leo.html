</p><p class="standard_Q">Projecting one's personality with confidence and warmth. Maintaining a positive self-image. Grooming oneself for success. Theatricality. Putting on a show. passionate involvement in life versus miffed withdrawal from center stage (too sensitive; stiff-necked pride). Unlocking vital energies. Mixing it up. Getting people to laugh (admonishing others to loosen up). Outward behavior.Â  Letting one's hair down. Telling it like it is (political humor). Putting one's finger on the key problem in a tangled situation. Formality vs. informality: long-haired music vs. rock and roll. Enthusiastic self-creation vs. uptight poses. Popularity-seeking. Charisma.
