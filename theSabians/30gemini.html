<h2>30 Gemini</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A BEAUTY PAGEANT IN A CIRCULAR HALL OF MIRRORS: A BEAUTIFUL CHILD IS LED OUT BEFORE THE JUDGE, AND PERFORMS A DANCE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Radiant projection of personality. Living up to one's ideal self-image. Being wise to one's own games vs. closing an eye to dishonesty (escaping detection with false fronts). Warm open-heartedness unclouded by personal secrets vs. disgust with self and others. Falling into the sins of one's associates vs. self-extrication. Picking one's way through a minefield. Finding a helpful guide in some underworld scene (Hermes as psychopomp). Leading people into the light. Cluing people into the inside story. Choreographing or rigging events. Figuring people out. Getting what one wants by giving people what they want. Integrating the public and private self vs. leading a double life. The soul's final judgement. Childlike innocence protected by worldly wisdom.
