<h2>21 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A WOMAN WITH A LANTERN STANDING AT A HALF-OPEN DOORWAY, KEYS AT HER BELT. APPROACHING FROM THE WOODS IS A WIDE-EYED LITTLE BOY.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Invitation to the inner world of the imagination. Bedtime stories. Spinning out tales. Enchantment: entering into the story. Playing the protagonist in one's own myth; trapped in subconscious scripts). Spiritual guides. Smoothing the path for others by shedding light on misperceptions. Bifocals: shifting from literal to allegorical interpretations. Trying out different interpretive keys to unconscious symbols. Psychology and occultism. Scary vortexes. The "castle perilous". Getting the lay of the land in a new or hostile environment. Gaining public legitimacy through some special talent in literature or music. Passing on spiritual knowledge to younger souls. Inner luminosity.
