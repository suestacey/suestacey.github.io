<h2>27 Taurus</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A CROONER SINGING AND STRUMMING HIS GUITAR. ON A BALCONY HIGH ABOVE, HIS BELOVED JOINS HIM IN SONG

</p><p class="standard_Q">The heavenly harp. Music expressing newfound cosmic harmonies. Sublimating erotic energies through music (gnostic distrust of the snares of physical love). Integrating the anima or animus (bisexuality). The power of love to shape the world. Music and dance as the soul's way to escape its sense of being imprisoned in the body (Rapunzel motif). Subverting society's restrictive customs and constructs (satire; burlesque). High vs. low culture. Remaining open to unseen possibilities. Tuning in to hidden forces (sympathetic magic). Chakras as the secret escape hatches of the body. Perception on the inner planes (clairvoyance, clairaudience). Flights of fantasy. The anima mundi.
