<h2>30 Sagittarius</h2>
<p class="standard_M">SITTING MOTIONLESS ON HIS THRONE, THE GNOME KING SURVEYS HIS VAST UNDERGROUND PALACE, PILED HIGH WITH GOLD AND TREASURE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Meditative realization that wealth, fame, glory, and spiritual knowledge are jewelled prisons of the living spirit (greed, pride, and wrath). Root desire to live within a stable reality system (crystallized dogmatism), or presenting alternative realities in order to jostle people out of their spiritual hypnosis. Visualizing power. Detailed artistic vision. Need to attend to one's own growth.
