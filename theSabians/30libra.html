<h2>30 Libra</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A PHRENOLOGIST DISCOVERS MOUNDS OF KNOWLEDGE ON A HEAD

</p><p class="standard_Q">Gnostic knowledge that opens the individual to a higher reality vs. knowledge valued for its own sake. Occult or scientific knowledge oriented towards self-liberation, or getting trapped in one's own desires and head-trips (the skull as a container). The serpent in the Garden. Narcissism and sexual knowingness which do not allow relationships the space to expand into higher forms. Cynical maneuverings in relationships. Spirit revealed in form. Kundalini (Pluto).
