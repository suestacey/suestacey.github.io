<h2>19 Taurus</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, LIGHTLY CLAD, LYING IN A FLOWERY FIELD. HER LOVER PLACES A WREATH OF WILDFLOWERS ON HER BROW.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Susceptibility to physical beauty. Innocence of heart. Courtship. Wooing and winning (multiple love affairs; plucking the daisies in the Elysian fields). Basing one's life on a romantic ideal (head in the clouds; belief in "happily ever after"). Meeting life as an unbounded field of new experiences. Excited optimism (utopianism; cloud castles; daydreams). Exploration, travel, adventure. Tracing simple outlines (children's stories; artistic illustration). Kind wisdom of the heart that has truly loved. Recounting one's experiences in the form of a simple romantic story. The meeting of heaven and earth in the realization of romantic love. Nature's luxuriant gifts. Persephone.
