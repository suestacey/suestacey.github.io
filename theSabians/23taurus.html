<h2>23 Taurus</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A JEWELER CASTS A CRITICAL EYE ON A DISPLAY OF VARICOLORED JEWELS

</p><p class="standard_Q">Discriminating the precious from the glittering and the sham. Training the eye. Perception of the divine light in others. Faithfulness of heart that is rewarded by other people's love (exasperation with other people's blindness). Self-depreciation: keeping one's own flaws and blind spots in mind. Love that lasts beyond the fading of physical beauty and even beyond death. Social activism based on a sense of the preciousness of human life. Lashing out at false values and degrading culture. Flamboyant verve vs. cheap flashiness (high-rollers). Incisive parody or self-parody (hyper-critical). Faithfulness to a vision of a better world. Planting seeds of love. The Pleiades.
