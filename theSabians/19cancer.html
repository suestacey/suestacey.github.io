<h2>19 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A PRINCE MARRIES A BEAUTIFUL ACTRESS AMIDST JOYFUL WELL-WISHERS FROM BOTH FAMILIES

</p><p class="standard_Q">Romantic love bridging two worlds. Finding a cultural middle ground. Standing on ceremony vs. loosening up a stuffy scene. Preserving one's honor vs. timely setting aside of pride. Wise observations. Humorous quips (irritable, snappy). Developing an audience (publicity-seeking; breaking taboos to create a stir). Disseminating new ideas and ideals through public forums. Fertilizing mass consciousness. Popularization. Glamorization of opposites that enhances sexual appeal. Domesticating the passions by getting familiar with them. Embodying a traditional ideal of beauty but breaking from expected behavior-patterns (sexual rebellion, scandal). Letting love act as one's guide. Advantageous marriages.
