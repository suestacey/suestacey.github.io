<h2>13 Taurus</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A PORTER CHEERFULLY BALANCING A MOUNTAIN OF BAGGAGE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Grasping one's situation in all its complexity. Keeping one's head and shoulders above one's worldly problems. Cheerfully accepting one's karma when there's no help for it, or rebelling against the imposed values of a dominant culture. Complainers. Resourcefulness and self-reliance. Taking on large-scale projects, or letting unimportant responsibilities drop. Unified assessment. Seeing the basic problem underlying many seemingly unrelated problems. Makeshift but immediately serviceable solutions. Throwing something together. Maneuvering. Getting out of a hole or a rut. Dangerous situations. One scrape after another. Daring-do. Physical courage. Cowboys and cowgirls. Heft.
