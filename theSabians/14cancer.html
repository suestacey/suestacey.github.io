<h2>14 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A SILENT MOVIE: THE CONDUCTOR SIGNALS THE ORCHESTRA  AS THE DARKENED SCREEN GIVES WAY TO A BIBLICAL EPIC

</p><p class="standard_Q">Accessing the higher self through active imagination. Inner vow to abide by the  decisions of the higher self whatever the cost (don't take themselves seriously; cartoon-like self-parody). Visualizing life as a passion play. Being strongly connected to one's own  story. Sharing the fate of one's daemon. Consciously moving between higher human consciousness and shamanic animal consciousness. Courageously answering the call of spiritual evolution. Spiritual decision (Abraham, Job). Bold statements in speech, clothing, and action. Dramatic flair. Making one's identity and meanings unmistakeable (hamming it up). Educating or edifying the public. Struggle of the divine to maintain its identity and freedom within the world. Dignity.
