<h2>7 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">EXPLORER, CAPTURED BY TRAINED MONKEYS, IS BROUGHT BEFORE THE KING OF THE LEPRECHAUNS AND FORCED TO DANCE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Resistance of the natural self to society's repressive expectations. Subversive challenges to consensus reality. Holding to personal and local myths. Maintaining one's worldview through inner dialogue. Breaking the mental chains of imposed culture (anti-colonialism). Stump-speeches for freedom (browbeating rants). Provocative social commentary. Penetrating observation of human behavior. Testing psychic insights by pushing people's buttons (cruel bullying). Turning the tables. Making people come to grips with one's reality. Undomesticated children of nature (satyr-like sexual kinkiness; unbounded fantasy life). Irrepressible individuality. Looking for an opening to express one's sexual or magical energies. Droll or mischievous humor.
