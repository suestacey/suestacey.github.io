<h2>9 Libra</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A RENAISSANCE PAINTING PICTURES ADAM AND EVE STANDING ON EITHER SIDE OF AN INFINITELY RECEDING GARDEN PATH

</p><p class="standard_Q">The soul's faith in the reality of the perceived world. Optimistic pursuit of life and love. Life as a dream play whose meaning is released through meditation. Essential universality of human experience. Deeper meanings of shared experience. Sensitivity to the symbolic substratum of one's experience.
