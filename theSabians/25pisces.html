<h2>25 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">AFTER DRASTIC REFORMS, A PURIFIED CLERGY OFFICIATES A NEW  WEDDING

</p><p class="standard_Q">Dealing with one's own emotional problems before taking on other people's problems. Dismal and futile preoccupations with the past. Removing psychological blockages. Struggling with lust, fear, or hate. Conquering one's internal demons so one can approach one's outer goals whole-heartedly. Rebaptism: renewed enthusiasm for living. Rededication to some meaningful goal or ideal. Sense of mission. Heroic efforts on behalf of mankind. Ineffectuality vs. winning in the stretch. Finding an answer, and then preaching it. Putting one's philosophy of life into practice. Easy-going modern sensibility. Establishing inner peace and finding oneself at peace with humanity. Integrity.
