<h2>8 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">CHRIST, BURNING WITH SPIRITUAL PASSION, PREACHES TO THE MONEY CHANGERS IN THE TEMPLE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Spiritual vision. Prophetic zeal. Revolution of consciousness around inwardly perceived spiritual truths (inner torment: struggle between smoldering desire and the fire of divine love). Emotional nobility vs. sexual defilement. Burning out vs. getting a second chance. Sincere desire to redeem humanity. Ministering to spiritual needs. Giving one's all. Tenderheartedness vs. hard-nosed street savvy. Uncovering a deep mystery (trading in spiritual truths). Liberating people with the inside scoop. Sudden appearance of a new force to be reckoned with. Channeling truths from a higher plane. Cultural and political revolutionaries.
