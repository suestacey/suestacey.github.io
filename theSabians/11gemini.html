<h2>11 Gemini</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A VIEW OF THE FOREST THROUGH THE FORKED TRUNKS OF A YOUNG ASPEN TREE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Calm and clear-headed view of one's situation and its possibilities. Innocence of heart which survives negative experience and springs anew from the ideal plane. Healing through forgiveness (teariness). Seeing the highest soul-image in others. Humorous familiarity with nature and with people. Seeing beyond divisions of form to the underlying unity of the spirit. Implicit connectedness. Country humor. Home-spun philosophy. Sharing one's insights with the public (navigating between mystical esotericism and banal popularization). Folksiness vs. sophistication. Countrified courtliness. Staying true to one's spiritual roots. Having the courage to act on one's ideals (self-righteous).
