<h2>17 Taurus</h2>
<p class="standard_M">SWORD-WIELDING HERO BATTLES A MAGICIAN HOLDING A MAGICAL TORCH. A WOMAN LOOKS ON ANXIOUSLY.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Subordinating selfish passions to spiritual will. Uncompromising justice in service of transpersonal truth. Mobilizing forces for a big campaign. Battles for political power that will determine the fate of whole peoples; drawing higher forces into the fray. Inspired leadership that can make cultural visions into realities. Imagination at the service of the passions or of divine justice:  the mesmerizing consort who turns the king's thoughts to sex and power, or who inspires him to become a glorious hero of his people. Perseus as the genie of the lamp. Palace intrigue vs. direct and courageous action (immersion in hateful conflicts). Psychological projection.
