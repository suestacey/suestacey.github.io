<h2>12 Aries</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A FORMATION OF GEESE FLYING INTO CLEAR BLUE SKIES

</p><p class="standard_Q">Spiritual leadership. Pure spirit liberated from matter. Liberating the spiritual meaning locked in the patterns of nature. Interlocking nature of the symbolic and the real. The twelve seasons as a spiritually unified cycle. Nature's longing for the divine as the basis of evolution.
