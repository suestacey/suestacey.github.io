<h2>13 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">RUGGED OLD SEA CAPTAIN SITS ON THE PORCH OF A LITTLE COTTAGE AND WATCHES A SHIP'S APPROACH, ITS GOLDEN HULL GLEAMING IN THE AFTERNOON SUN.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Endurance. Developing strength of personality by standing up to the tests of Â experience. Remaining true to one's archetypal patterns (astrological or mythic self-knowledge). Keeping sight of distant spiritual goals. Digging in for the long haul. Putting oneself to the test vs. saving one's energy. Periods of adventure alternating with rest and reflection. Distilling archetypal truths from one's experience (epic poetry, literature). Maintaining one's mobility vs. getting bogged down by social constraints (Odysseus and Circe). Depth of feeling. Suffering emotional losses without ceasing to care. Staying on course through fair weather and foul. Gaining personal momentum. Making an impact.
