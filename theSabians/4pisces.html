<h2>4 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A BRIDGE BETWEEN TWO ISLAND NATIONS. A MASSIVE CUSTOMS GATE SLOWS TRAFFIC TO A CRAWL.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Flow vs. frustration. Developing new lines of communication vs. mistrust. Renegotiating the rules of a relationship. Getting out from under someone else's unstated rules of behavior. Pulling one's own strings vs. feeling shackled. Careful navigation of social situations (karmic repercussions of clumsiness and short-sightedness, or flaws in one's chain of logic). Palace politics: thwarting one's enemies' ambitions, while extending admission to one's friends. The social compact: deciding whether to play by the rules. Navigating romantic situations between the Scylla and Charybdis of puritanism and licentiousness. Loosening and tightening of cultural constraints.
