<h2>11 Virgo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A WOMAN GIVES EACH OF HER CHILDREN A LOAF OF BREAD AND A SPIKE OF BARLEY, AND SENDS THEM OUT INTO THE WORLD

</p><p class="standard_Q">The limitless ways that one's inherited spiritual values can find concrete expression. Fearless venturing into the world. Dispelling evil and darkness with the light of one's inner goodness. Simple goodness reflected in thought and speech. Planting seeds of truth:  Ceres.
