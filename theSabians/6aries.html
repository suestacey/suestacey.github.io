<h2>6 Aries</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A MISCHIEVOUS FIRE-IMP TRAPPED IN A CUBICAL BLACK TINDER BOX

</p><p class="standard_Q">Irritation and desire for change. Forcing society to come to grips with its problems. Revolt against socially-sanctioned suppression of truth, or internal struggles projected onto the world. The intellect as a two-sided force which is both good and evil. The spirit of invention. Mischievous humor. Instigation. Verbal key between conscious and subconscious.
