<h2>19 Gemini</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A MAN READING A BEAUTIFULLY ILLUMINATED ALCHEMIST TEXT WITH THE AID OF MAGNIFYING GLASS

</p><p class="standard_Q">The attempt to bring one's inner text into sharp focus. The child's attunement to its own archetypes. Living life confidently on the basis of what one already knows. Solipsism: living in one's own world. Deciphering the symbolic outlines of one's experience. Surprising new revelations as the pages of one's life turn. Sage and humorous commentary from the sidelines (elfin mischievousness). Giving others the lowdown. Alchemy and fairy tales.
