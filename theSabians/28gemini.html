<h2>28 Gemini</h2>
<p class="standard_M">HAVING BEEN DECLARED LEGALLY BANKRUPT, A MAN SHRUGS HIS SHOULDERS AND LEAVES THE COURT

</p><p class="standard_Q">Knowing when to invest energy and emotion in something and when to blow it off. Extricating oneself from no-win situations vs. passionately pleading one's case (collaring people). Patiently finding the real openings in complex social situations. Thinking things through to their probable outcomes (precipitate, desperate action). Going about one's life calmly without being thrown off balance by hope or fear (emotional see-saws). Humorous or Zen-like detachment from the world-illusion (Exasperating interconnectness of society's lies. Sense of futility and emptiness). Making practical compromises vs. getting hung up on unimportant points. Getting out from under collective pressures and collective karma. Gaining the world by losing it.
