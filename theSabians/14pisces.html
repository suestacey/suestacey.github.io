<h2>14 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">GLAMOROUS ACTRESS IN A FOX STOLE, IN FRONT OF A PAINTED BACKDROP

</p><p class="standard_Q">The Moon in its dual role: as artistic muse or as sexual temptress (the slippery path of sensuality descending into a pit of base desires). Unmistakable personal style. Embodying an imaginative ideal. Life as art. Composure. Spreading civilization or culture. Making whatever one has attractive and desirable. Subtlety and caginess. Awareness of snares.
