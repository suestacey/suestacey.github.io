<h2>5 Taurus</h2>
<p class="standard_M">FOREIGN SOLDIERS TUNNEL BENEATH THE WALLS OF THE CAPITAL CITY, WHILE AN OUTLANDISH AIRSHIP DROPS PROJECTILES FROM OVERHEAD.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Spreading vital new cultural forms to the outback. Expanding the limits of local culture. Raids into foreign territory (imperviousness to foreign culture vs. appropriating their stuff). The law as society's way of defining its limits (cutting the Gordian knot vs. getting crucified in someone else's system; self-extrication). Holding to one's nation's basic values vs. adopting trendy cultural artifacts. Cultural reconnaissance vs. shoring up society's defenses. Collapse of old scenes. Painful realization of transience that puts one in touch with timeless values. Mental and emotional range (musical talent). Fatal flaws that allow more vital cultures to take over. Utilitarian refashioning.
