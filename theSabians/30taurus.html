<h2>30 Taurus</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A PEACOCK PARADES ON THE GROUNDS OF AN OLD MANSION

</p><p class="standard_Q">Class acts. Aristocratic bearing and tastes. Gaining admittance to elite circles vs.  causing tongues to cluck and losing favor. Peacocks as guard animals-guarding established society from parvenus (crashing the gate). Arbiters of fashions and values. Enjoying wealth and status without taking it too seriously. Retaining a good balance of dignity and humility regardless of social position. Maintaining appearances (vanity; peevish imperiousness). Daring extension of traditional artistic forms (going too far with splashy effects; tail end of a tradition; decadence or kitsch). Gracefulness vs. gawkiness. Good manners vs. scandalous displays. Refined artistic tastes.
