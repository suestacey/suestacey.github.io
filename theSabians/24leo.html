<h2>24 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">IN A SHABBY GARRET, A TALENTED WRITER IS BURNING THE MIDNIGHT OIL

</p><p class="standard_Q">Mastering one's situation by parlaying one's assets wisely. Perfecting one's talents through rigorous practice. Inner nobility that eventually manifests. Upholding high standards. Grouchy dismissal of weak people. Connection to the sublime that renders creature comfort unimportant. Bohemianism. Artistic luxury amidst shabbiness. Saving for an upgrade. Fearless, passionate living. Playing the game of life by one's own rules, but with a strict code of personal honor (uncompromising). Concentration. Tapping inner potentials (the Self as a microcosm of the world on an ideal plane). Gaining self-mastery and with it the ability to command others. Unshakable self-confidence.
