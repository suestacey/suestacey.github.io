<h2>20 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">REVELERS IN A VENETIAN GONDOLA GLIDE THROUGH RIPPLING MOONLIT WATERS

</p><p class="standard_Q">Sensitivity to the impressionistic beauty of nature. The imprint of passing moments on the heart. Emotional moorings in romanticized past events (nostalgic regret; living in the past). Emotional responsiveness and flexibility that allows one to take advantage of all of life's possibilities. Making emotional connections. Reassuring others. Confident outreach. Romance. Getting people to enter into your romantic vision or dance to your tunes. The big night out (entering the heart-shaped tunnel of love). Tours of special places. Making love. Living a full emotional life. Speaking for a constituency. Keeping human institutions responsive to humans. The moon as a silvery boat. Sparkle.
