<h2>22 Taurus</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A CARRIER PIGEON FLIES STRAIGHT OVER A CROWDED CITY

</p><p class="standard_Q">Urgent sense of spiritual mission. Bringing back the Word. The loving heart trying to find a friendly haven in an uncaring world (sense of being dispossessed). Preserving the beauty and sensitivity of the soul within degrading conditions (dire straits, last-minute rescues or escapes). Disseminating higher human values. Hopefulness: looking beyond the limitations of the immediate situation. Hidden faculties that allow the soul to communicate with higher planes of being (antenna-like connection to higher spiritual frequencies). Ability to calm and uplift people's emotions (very musical). Beautiful inner landscapes. Spiritual attunement.
