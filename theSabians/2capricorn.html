<h2>2 Capricorn</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A GOTHIC CATHEDRAL, PRACTICALLY DESTROYED BY WAR, ITS ROSE WINDOW STILL INTACT

</p><p class="standard_Q">The ability (or inability) of personal fortunes and social structures to survive the blows of fate. Cultural preservation (art, architecture). Allegiance to an old-fashioned world view. Life of the soul rooted in the spiritual light of bygone days (or ill-fated attempt to hold on to the past in all of its more concrete manifestations). Centering oneself in the inner light. Embodying a spiritual tradition.
