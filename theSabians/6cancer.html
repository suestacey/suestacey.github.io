<h2>6 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">HEAD OF THE CLAN DIRECTS THE STAKING OUT OF A NEW HOMESTEAD AND THE FRAMING OF A NEW HOUSE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Rejecting the oppressive conditions of one's household, workplace or state and striking out on one's own. Restructuring social institutions to meet human needs. Founding a new household or state on firmly held principles (remain in unpleasant but secure situations, but feel displaced or imprisoned). Wanting to feel competent and assured at one level of development before venturing to the next. Having a firm grasp of one's situation vs. being caught unawares (dangers preceding the consolidation of one's position). Expanding one's sphere of influence. Promoting teamwork vs. ordering people around (need to call the shots; dictatorial). Political and social vision. Leadership.
