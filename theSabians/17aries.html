<h2>17 Aries</h2>
<p class="standard_M">PRIM AND SILENT GIANTESS SEATED IN A CHAIR FLANKED BY TWO STONE LIONS

</p><p class="standard_Q">Fidelity to a private and seed-like vision of the world. The virgin priestess who holds fast to the point of emergence. Withdrawing from and analyzing one's ventures into passionate experience. Life as an object lesson in the straight and narrow. Discovering the relationship between individual and community standards of morality and truth.
