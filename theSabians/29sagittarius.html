<h2>29 Sagittarius</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A HAIRY HUN CUTTING GRAIN WITH A SICKLE

</p><p class="standard_Q">The end of a major life cycle and the harvest of experience. Death of the old, to clear the way for the new (periodic political revolutions). Mercilessly sharp analysis of past experiences used to cut through obstacles to the future. Physical strength and agility. Ridding oneself of anything that is inessential to the future.
