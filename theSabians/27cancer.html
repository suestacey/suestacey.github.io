<h2>27 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A FURIOUS STORM RAGES THROUGH A RESIDENTIAL CANYON

</p><p class="standard_Q">Revelation of the terrible power of nature, which destroys superficial, materialistic world views. Heightening of consciousness through emotional intensification. Shaking up the status quo. Pressing a point in public dialogue. Shocking the public into recognizing some imminent danger and taking a stand. Apocalyptic scenarios. Decisive battles between good and evil. Precariousness of civilization in the face of unconscious or natural forces. Overwhelming one's opponent with a higher order of force (violent frenzy, descent into barbarism, as during war). Aggressive provocation (impishness; Neptune prodding with his trident). Fearless sexual or physical confrontation. Naked force.
