<h2>19 Capricorn</h2>A LITTLE GIRL PUSHING A SHOPPING CART HELPS HER MOTHER WITH THE MARKETING
<p class="standard_M">

</p><p class="standard_Q">The seed self, which often becomes buried in things extraneous to itself. Faithfulness to one's original purpose in life. Taking serious account of one's life's mission. Developing personal momentum. Getting things rolling. Attempting to change the course of human events (anguished sense of impotence). Getting sidelined versus staying on course. Informing all thoughts and actions with one's basic values (hidden agendas). Finding concrete ways to show one's love for others. Working for one's country's well-being (protecting it from negative influences). Being careful of the type of karma one is generating (getting buried in one's own stuff vs. self-extrication). Ability to grasp and hold people's attention. Embodying an ideal self-image. The scarab.
