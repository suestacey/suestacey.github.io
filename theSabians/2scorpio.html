<h2>2 Scorpio</h2>A BOTTLE OF PERFUME FALLS AND BREAKS ON THE FLOOR
<p class="standard_M">

</p><p class="standard_Q">Shattering experiences that change the entire picture. Reintegrating one's life after some important loss. Making a unified emotional reappraisal. Bitter regrets. Emotional scarring. Envy towards the more fortunate or successful. Social striving. Protecting one's position (use of threats or violence). The elixir of compassion that develops only after the biter has been bit. Healing forgiveness. "Fatal" events that help one to reestablish a clear view of reality.
