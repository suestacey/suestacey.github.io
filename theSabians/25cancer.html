<h2>25 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">SOMEONE SUDDENLY THROWS A MANTLE OVER THEIR RIGHT SHOULDER

</p><p class="standard_Q">Living out a self-created role. Taking delight in one's act (self-caricature, the smiling Medusa). Theatrical grandstanding. Comic antics. Brashness and verve. Doing what one wants to do. Throwing off social constraints. Sense of personal invincibility (foolhardy tempting of fate). Bold schemes. Narrow escapes. Jinks and high-jinks (lawlessness, imbroglios). Getting caught in the act). Personal mythology based on both fact and imagination. Wrapped up in themselves: outwardly very public; inwardly very private. Playing one's hand skillfully. Maximizing personal assets. Resourcefully confronting impossible situations. Daring to live life as a great drama or adventure. Self-reliance.
