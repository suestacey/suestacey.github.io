<h2>5 Capricorn</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A CALL TO ACTION

</p><p class="standard_Q">Taking command of the situation. Emotionally "psyching" the public to action on their own behalf. Issues of power: its use and misuse. Succumbing to power-lust and demagoguery, or maintaining an objective overview of the situation. Bold action based on keen foresight and a sense of destiny. Decisive and sometimes violent removal of obstacles to progress. Eliminating side issues to facilitate major group undertakings (fascistic demand for unity). Setting armies marching.
