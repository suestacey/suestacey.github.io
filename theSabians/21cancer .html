<h2>21 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">NURSE IN A JUNGLE MISSION UTTERS AN IMPASSIONED PRAYER FOR THE LIFE OF ONE OF HER PATIENTS

</p><p class="standard_Q">Spiritual duty to help humanity and one's country. Having a mission in life. Moving into the breach. Showing one's love for humanity through commitment, exertion, and sacrifice. Taking on public karma and pain. Viewing oneself as the hero or heroine of a romantic drama. Saving the day. Carrying a powerful image of the beautiful and the just in one's breast. Innocence of heart as the jewel of great price. Knowing the score without becoming the score (victimized by degrading experiences; desecrating the temple through ugly sex). Rosicrucian chivalric romance vs. sacrifices to idols of lust. Issues of esoteric vs. exoteric religion. Obeying the soul's higher impulses (the Strength card of the Tarot). Slow penetration of ideals into social and political structures. Philanthropic institutions.
