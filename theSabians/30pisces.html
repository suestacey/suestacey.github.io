<h2>30 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">OLD EXPLORER AND YOUNG LOVER LIVING IN A CHALET ON THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN

</p><p class="standard_Q">Overstepping social boundaries in youth then retiring into more conservative ways.  Ignoring social norms, especially concerning love (sexual "deviance," odd couples).  Living into a self-created ideal. Exemplars to a new generation. Teaching from experience (futile attempt to get children to accept one's own limits). Getting trapped in a self-consistent ego-image vs. breaking the mold and trying out a bold new persona. Feeling stymied vs. re-entering the flow. Retaining childlike spontaneity and love of fun in spite of accumulated experience (sense of having seen it all). Foolishly bearing the weight of the world vs. wisely entering a fool's paradise. Inner vs. outer freedom.
