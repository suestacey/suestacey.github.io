<h2>2 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">SQUIRREL, CHASED BY A HUNTER, DASHES UP A TREE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Being tossed about by a dizzying whirl of event, or making things revolve around oneself. Victimization vs. taking charge. Turning the tables. Rising through the ranks by proving competence in the management of affairs. Concentrating a new solar center. Being in or out of the closet: hiding something or brazening it out. Being exposed or exposing oneself. Bringing a moral or social issue to the public eye through guerrilla theater. Mad scrambles and hasty retreats. Finding a safe haven within existing social structures, or turning society upside-down. Being game for adventure vs. running scared. Fast-lane, slow-lane issues.
