<h2>13 Capricorn</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A FATHER AND SON SEATED BEFORE A BLAZING FIRE ON THE EDGE OF A PROMONTORY. BELOW, A SHINING VALLEY WREATHED IN MORNING MIST.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Patriotism based on a deep sense of oneness with the land. Consecrating oneself to the intelligent service of one's country. Political activism: uncovering and eliminating abuses. Unconditional dedication of the Self, with all its skills and ambitions, to some greater end. Concentrating one's efforts through chastity of life (Vesta). The fires of innermost conviction. Concern for the future (worriers). Passing the torch to the next generation. Nature mysticism.
