<h2>15 Capricorn</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A PRIEST AMUSES A BEDRIDDEN CHILD WITH MECHANICAL DOLLS, WHOSE ACTIONS AND WORKINGS HE EXPLAINS

</p><p class="standard_Q">Defining or modifying behavioral role models (children as the captive audience of their parents). One's world-view as an internalized model. Psychoanalysis: deconstructing childhood assumptions at the root of personality defects by reliving traumatic situations in the imagination. Bridging misunderstandings and incorrect assumptions that cause rifts between people, classes, generations, sexes, or nations. Alternately teacherly and silly, pompous and receptive. Simplified explanations that illuminate the broad outlines of a problem. Resourcefulness. Mechanical inventiveness.
