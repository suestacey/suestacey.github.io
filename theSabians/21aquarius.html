<h2>21 Aquarius</h2>
<p class="standard_M"> DISILLUSIONED ACTRESS WEEPS QUIETLY IN FRONT OF HER BOUDOIR MIRROR. SERVANTS IN ATTENDANCE.

</p><p class="standard_Q">

Artistic talent.  Music, poetry, dance. Reflecting a vision of the divine. Emotionally sensitizing the public through art (aristocratic stratification of society; racism). Unrequited love. Suffering which adds depth to art. Sad impossibility of attaining the heavenly ideal within this world. Soul-stirring beauty. The essential emptiness and vanity of life.  Pity (self-pity).
