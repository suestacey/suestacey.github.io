<h2>4 Taurus</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A SHOWER OF GOLD COINS FALLS FROM THE COAT OF A WHITE GOAT. A LITTLE MAN COLLECTS THE COINS IN A GOLDEN CHAMBER-POT.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Seeing through the screen of matter to the hidden nature of things. Intuitive perception of the spiritual organizing principles of reality. Developing a core analysis (monomaniacs). Spiritual teachings (guru-trips; tempted from the spiritual gold by physical  gold). The essential fluidity of reality: tweaking people's realities. Magic or just blarney: stage patter. Winning people over to one's beliefs with golden-tongued charm (selling them a bill of goods). Scattering one's words vs. collecting one's best insights. Spiritual alchemy and self-transformation (self-absorption). People with precious gifts vs. vaudevillains and deceivers.
