<h2>9 Taurus</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A DECORATED HOLIDAY TREE.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Self-renewal through sharing with others. A remaking of ties and a regathering of visions through the recurrent birth of the shared Spirit. Passing on good values. Knowing what others need for proper growth. Resourcefulness: coming up with just what's needed (morose; worry about survival even in times of plenty). Enriching everyday experience. Music, dance, and mechanical inventiveness. Making something new out of old parts. Evolutionary spiral: respecting every level in the dance of life. Issues of emotional flexibility. Life as a song with major and minor keys (being a wallflower or a stick-in-the-mud vs. letting loose and having a good time). Celebrating the organized chaos of life. Multiple levels of activity in active family life.
