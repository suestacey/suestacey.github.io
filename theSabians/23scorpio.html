<h2>23 Scorpio</h2>
<p class="standard_M">MAN CHASES A HARE, WHICH TURNS INTO A CARTOON OF ITSELF AND DUCKS THROUGH A STONE WALL

</p><p class="standard_Q">Following hunches. Escaping false realities by following up on contradictory evidence. Shortcuts to the future. Utopianism (escapism). Getting beyond the illusion of one's projected reality (matter is mostly space). The 5th dimension: approached through imagination and science.
