<h2>3 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A GIANT PETRIFIED TREE, WITH LIVING SHOOTS SPROUTING FROM ITS ROOTS

</p><p class="standard_Q">Standing firmly within some older world-view, or some childhood vision (inflexible, pursuing a dead-end course to the bitter end). Fatalism: seeing few options consistent with personal integrity. Signposts showing where we went wrong: where society abandoned its visions. Diagnosis and prescription of society's ills. Ministering to one's fellows (paralyzed with dismay). Social influence thrust upon one by fate. Deep thinkers (self-absorbed). Natural wisdom rooted in the body. Freeing up rigidities caused by physical or emotional suffering. Weathering superficial change. Being rooted in the deeper realities of life and death. Legacies from the old to the young. Guardianship.
