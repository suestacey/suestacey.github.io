<h2>18 Aries</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A GIANT, WITH OUTSTRETCHED ARMS, STANDING BETWEEN TWO TREES

</p><p class="standard_Q">The giant personifies nature, with its broad tolerance of all living things. Embracing life with an open heart. The common touch. Drawing peace and strength from the bosom of nature. Rest which precedes any new cycle of activity (laziness). Physical strength. Enthusiastic work for humanitarian goals.
