<h2>3 Libra</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A RURAL SOUTHERN HOMESTEAD AT DAWN. THE GRANDFATHER LIES DYING WHILE HIS WIDE-EYED GRANDSON EXPLORES THE YARD.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Death of the past which leads to a rebirth of the present. Interdependence of life and death, yin and yang, light and darkness. Revivifying self-discovery made possible by the death of old ego structures. Openness and sensitivity to the environment. Wonder.
