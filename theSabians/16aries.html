<h2>16 Aries</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A WEARY WANDERER, WITH A RED ROSE STUCK IN THEIR HAT, STOPS MOMENTARILY TO LOOK BACK AT THE SETTING SUN

</p><p class="standard_Q">Openness to the unfolding poetry of life. The ability to leave the past behind and set out on a new life adventure. Openness of heart. Recentering. Realigning heart and will.
