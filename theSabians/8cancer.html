<h2>8 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A HARE IN HUMAN CLOTHING BEING CHASED BY A WOMAN RIDING A TIGER

</p><p class="standard_Q">Irreverent parody of the human animal and his bestial institutions. Penetrating look at human relationships. Confronting society with its own unconsciousness. Raising the level of public discussion. Espousing unpopular opinions (sense of being targeted for one's looks, race, gender, or sexual orientation-- flaunting one's individuality anyway). Running the ragged edge (serious indiscretions; sense that all is fair in love and war; cruelty, inhumanity). Origin of human behavior in the basic emotions of fear and erotic love. Life as a chase (social games; competition for social prestige; courtiers and knaves). Brave individualism vs. hiding behind an assigned role. Exaggerating for effect.
