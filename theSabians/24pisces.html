<h2>24 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A MAN BUILDS HIS OWN WORLD ON A TINY ISLAND

</p><p class="standard_Q">Science as the discovery of patterns and laws that order the phenomena of the physical world. Rationalism: extending consciousness into new realms. Abstracting new laws and then testing them (over-generalization; insularity). Accepting mental confusion as a forerunner to new constructs. Thinking out loud. Relying on thoughts and data close at hand. Travel as a way to break mental deadlocks. Trading places. Exasperated sense of displacement and intellectual isolation vs. creating common ground for communication. Sense of irreducible individuality. Language problems. Students of human behavior. The essential fluidity of reality even at its most concrete.
