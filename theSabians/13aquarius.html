<h2>13 Aquarius</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A WOMAN STICKS HER HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW AND LOOKS AT A BAROMETER HANGING UNDER THE EAVES

</p><p class="standard_Q">Withdrawing in order to assess one's options. Convincing oneself, or the public, of the need to change course (properly gauging the climate of opinion and one's own social status). Seizing one's opportunity (overly cautious). Evolving, up-to-date perspective. Anticipating the future. Cleverly picking out the central truth of a situation.
