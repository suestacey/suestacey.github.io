<h2>28 Scorpio</h2>
<p class="standard_M">THE FOREST AT TWILIGHT: A MAJESTIC OBERON CONTEMPLATES THE DYING RAYS OF THE SUN, WHILE PUCK PLAYS AT HIS FEET.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Nature mysticism. Cloaking of the divine spirit within the forms of nature. The sleep of the creation. The child's natural attunement to Spirit. Fertile relationship between wisdom and foolishness. Potency and impotency. Puckish humor. Pagan devotion. Seeing the One in the All.
