<h2>10 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">AVIATOR SAILS ACROSS THE SKY, MASTER OF THE HIGH REALMS

</p><p class="standard_Q">Olympian overview. The reflective mind (the gnostic Sophia), which cloaks the thoughts of god in image and form. Materializing one's artistic or social visions. Transforming one's environment into a castle of horrors or a celestial palace, according to whether love or selfishness rule the personality. Natural hierarchy. Use or misuse of knowledge and power. Questions of allegiance. Channeling prophetic wisdom (emotional distortions). Self-fulfilling prophecies: finding confirmations of one's hopes or fears. Attunement and mental clarity bred of emotional serenity. Taking one's place in the cosmic order. Giddy imaginings, or restoring perspective through humorous interjection.
