<h2>23 Aries</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A WOMAN IN SUMMER DRESS IS CARRYING A PRECIOUS VEILED BURDEN

</p><p class="standard_Q">Refining one's individual style of beauty. Sublimating love for others by developing and  sharing works of beauty. Seeing the unity of mankind through the veils of custom and costume (too concerned with appearances). Sense of social justice. Protecting one's more delicate feelings from the harshness of the world.
