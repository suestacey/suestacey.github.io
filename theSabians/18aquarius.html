<h2>18 Aquarius</h2>
<p class="standard_M">URGED ON BY THE WOMEN, THE LAST MAN AT A MASQUERADE PARTY PREPARES TO UNMASK

</p><p class="standard_Q">Appearance vs. reality: what goes on beneath the masked veneer of social interaction. Vulnerable honesty vs. fearful cloaking of motives and misanthropic withdrawal. People watching. Insight into human behavior. Psychological acuity. Consecration to ideals. Standing naked before God, especially at the instant of death.
