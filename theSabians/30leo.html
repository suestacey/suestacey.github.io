<h2>30 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">AN UNSEALED LETTER HAS VITAL AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

</p><p class="standard_Q">Radiant faith in the goodness of life (operating out of unquestioned social assumptions; living up to parental expectations; blasâ€š normality). Penetration of personal will by divine will (attunement). Serving the laws of one's divine nature as one's highest duty. Following inner directives. Remembering what one is about, vs. losing oneself in unthinking routines (ineffectuality). Humbly accepting one's child-like role in the larger scheme. Belief that human actions have no large-scale effects vs. learning to pluck some magic from the cosmic lyre. Regulus, the heart of Leo, symbolizing the unvarying cycles of the cosmic order (astrological fatalism). Sunny transcendence of worldly cares.
