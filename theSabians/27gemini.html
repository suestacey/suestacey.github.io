<h2>27 Gemini</h2>
<p class="standard_M">GYPSY LOOKS TOWARDS A CRYSTAL CITY, PERCHED ATOP A MOUNTAIN OVERGROWN WITH BRAMBLES

</p><p class="standard_Q">Following one's star, or losing one's ideals in a thicket of everyday concerns. Materializing one's highest vision of oneself. Materializing an archetype in the group mind in an individualistic way (empty conformity to group ideals. Mannered posing). Personal magnetism and polish. Drawing envy and admiration. Fame and scandal. Holding to the  timeless light of the soul (spiritual and physical decay; fading movie star mode). Spiritual immortality (Sleeping Beauty's castle). Finding the seat of one's inner knowledge. Curious and unique viewpoint. Keen observation of social customs (the city as human anthill; mazes). Surreal visions (art). Finding one's niche vs. scaling the highest heights.
