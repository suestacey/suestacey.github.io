<h2>15 Taurus</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A STRANGER WALKS INTO TOWN IN THE MIDST OF A VIOLENT WINDSTORM. HE IS WEARING A SILK TOP HAT, AND CARRYING A LARGE BLACK BAG.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Unflappability. Flexibly adapting to the unique conformation of forces in one's situation. Applying just the right amount of force (disastrous misjudgment). The doctor-magician: able to channel powerful natural energies. Controller of hidden natural forces (wild, undomesticated, sexual and occult powers). Voodoo vs. hoodoo. Resourcefulness: finding the right solution in one's bag of tricks. Seriousness vs. frivolity. Feigned severity (browbeating and needling) vs. serious humor (truth-laden zaniness). Constructing the situation in the most promising way. Chiron-like unboundedness of reality vs. inescapability of primal forces. Divination as oracle or card-trick.
