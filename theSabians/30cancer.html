<h2>30 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">GUEST SPEAKER ADDRESSES AN EXCLUSIVE CLUB IN THE MIDST OF A ROSE GARDEN

</p><p class="standard_Q">Gaining admittance to the in-crowd (formerly through family connections, now through talent or cultural cache). Hitting upon some pose or cultural product that wins one great popularity. Intuitive penetration of mass psychology (hip to everyone's games but their own, in-jokes). Emotional refinement: holding oneself above disturbing passions. Seeing the world as one's private playground (an illusion or creation of mind).  Finding one's natural place in the realm of mental images after death (heaven and hell) . Living by one's spiritual principles vs. esotericism as a way of being in the know. Rising above people's unconsciousness vs. having to wall it off. Cliquishness of the rich, hip or holy.
