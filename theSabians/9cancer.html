<h2>9 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A NAKED CHILD TRYING TO CATCH A GOLDFISH

</p><p class="standard_Q">Curiosity and open-mindedness. Trusting one's instincts when one doesn't know how to handle a situation. Conquering one's shyness and inhibitions. Stilling the anxious workings of the mind and getting into the swim of things (stick-in-the-muds; crabby sniping from the sidelines). Innocent, experiential approach to sex, vs. trollish leering. Fresh, enthusiastic response to life's infinite possibilities. Trying to grasp the ineffable paradoxes of life. Slippery truths of religion and philosophy (tall tales, "fish stories"; sci-fi and fantasy). Fishing for the truth and apprehending only part of it (the elephant's trunk). Surrealism and non-sense. Playfulness. Giddy humor.
