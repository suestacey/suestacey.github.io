<h2>22 Gemini</h2>
<p class="standard_M">YOUNG TWINS DO-SI-DO IN A JOYOUS BARN DANCE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Dancers vs. wallflowers. Getting social energies moving. Enthusiastic involvement (drained; retire to the country to recharge). Gaining a voice in the larger social dialogue. Bringing unfamiliar ideas into common usage. Identifying the spiritual problems of one's age, and offering a creative, healing response. Getting a handle on the situation vs. Â inability to find a point of entry. Maintaining one's goals but changing one's tack (counter-cultural attacks vs. going mainstream. Polarization vs. new syntheses). Youthful idealism rounded out by a deep reflection on one's experience. Social analysis. Being one step ahead of one's time vs. being out of step. Routine pleasures vs. trying a new step.
