<h2>15 Sagittarius</h2>
<p class="standard_M">GROUND HOG, OUT OF ITS WINTER SLEEP, LOOKS FOR ITS SHADOW

</p><p class="standard_Q">Foreshadowing of future events and willingness to follow up on these intuitions (timidity and vacillation). Omens and symbolic correspondences. Developing intuition by putting it to the test. Relaxed state of mind: open to both conscious and unconscious stimuli (misses the obvious, misperceptions). Active engagement vs. boredom and withdrawal.
