<h2>3 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">ARCTIC EXPLORER, FOLLOWING UP REPORTS OF A UNICORN, BRINGS BACK A REINDEER INSTEAD

</p><p class="standard_Q">ï»¿Research. New directions of inquiry opened up by new understandings (stuck in old formulas). Staying on top of new interpretations. Getting in the last word. Nailing down the facts. Demystification. Puncturing false stories (criticism; irony, sarcasm). Commitment to ideas that faithfully represent reality. Seeing new patterns and checking them out. Language and symbol as the basis of culture (Eden vs. Babel). Developing new languages to get at new truths (musical, chemical or mathematical languages; social allegory). Farseeing commitment to the advancement of civilization. Standing up for the underdog: for peasants, children, animals. Penetrating insight. Noble but lonely quest for truth.
