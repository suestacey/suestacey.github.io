<h2>14 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">THE CHRIST CHILD, SURROUNDED BY A LUMINOUS CLOUD OF WHISPERING CHERUBS

</p><p class="standard_Q">Sense of spiritual mission. Incarnation of divine love (pained by man's turning an inhuman face towards others). Learning to believe in oneself (intense need for approval, unrealistic emotional demands that strain personal relationships). Intimacy, confidences. Sage advice. Embodying a personal mythology. Self-creation. Sustaining an illusion (fear that one's illusion will come crashing down, unconsciously conjuring up dire situations). Teaming up with powerful people (illusion-masters in the media). Unconditional trust of the child vs. fearful need to control the outer world. Dispelling the clouds of the world-illusion with the light of all-embracing compassion. Gentle forgiveness. Luminosity.
