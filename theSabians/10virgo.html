<h2>10 Virgo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A MAN WITH TWO HEADS LOOKING OUT INTO THE BEYOND

</p><p class="standard_Q">Two-sided personality, with each side being repellent to the other. Internal quarreling and self-criticism, followed by self-transcendence and an opening up to the world at large. Probing curiosity. Desire for omniscience. Irreducible paradox as an undeniable fact of the cosmos.
