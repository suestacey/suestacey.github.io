<h2>19 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">REVELERS ON A HOUSEBOAT, DANCING TO THE SOUNDS OF A SWINGBAND

</p><p class="standard_Q">Generating fun and laughter. Indulging oneself (expect to be indulged). Taking a vacation. Healthy escape from social restrictions (escapism). Encouraging people to accept themselves and plunge into life (go overboard). Sincere, warmly persuasive communication. Gently touching the heart. Local heros who preach the wisdom of the common man (cultivated banality). Faith in God's love and forgiveness. Going with what feels right (hedonism vs. chaperone-like moralizing). Personal rectitude. Living up an image, but also being able to loosen up and play the fool. Hamming it up. Drama, music. Popular fiction (fully identified with a mythic persona; poor reality sense). Wisdom of the heart.
