<h2>5 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">MASTER CLIMBER DEFTLY ASCENDS AN UNSEEN SERIES OF HAND HOLDS. HAVING GAINED THE SUMMIT, HE TURNS AND EXHORTS THE CLIMBING PARTY BELOW.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Rugged determination. Never letting up or letting go. Clawing one's way to the top. Holding to hard-won advantages. Keeping one's mind on the business at hand vs. getting involved in everyone else's business. Competition vs. cooperation. Dependence of the individual's level of evolution on the group, and vice versa (publicize private concerns; personalize public concerns). Standing firmly behind one's position (wrongheaded beliefs). Inspired rants. Preaching the truth. Talking oneself or others into following some risky plan (foolhardy). Cliffhangers. Challenging oneself to escape the jail of poverty or obscurity. Serving as a shining inspiration (self-advertisement).
