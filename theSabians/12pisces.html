<h2>12 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">CANDIDATES ARE EXAMINED AT THE DOOR OF THE INNER SANCTUM

</p><p class="standard_Q">Dramatization. Living out one's own myths. Essential fluidity of reality. Joining with others to create a scene. Playing one's part with zest (Auntie Mame-ism)'. The "big night". Unveiling ambitious public projects. Fulfilling obligations to the group. Admission to elite circles, and helpful connections made there. Back-stage leaders in interlocking political, cultural, and spiritual spheres. Figuring out a scene and moving on. Choosing one's intimates and associates carefully, or seeing them mess up the works. Privileged information. Getting the lowdown. Clarifying murky intuitions. Pulling it all together, or living happily within a confusion of incongruities. Splendid pleasures.
