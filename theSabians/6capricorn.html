<h2>6 Capricorn</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A BRICK WALL SURROUNDING AN ANCIENT FOREST. STANDING NEXT TO AN ARCHED GATEWAY, A DIMINUTIVE BEARDED MAN IN FOREIGN GARB

</p><p class="standard_Q">Clowning around. Humorously puncturing society's solipsistic and ingrown habits of perception, as if from a foreign perspective (exiles and misfits). Coming at things from a more instinctive level (Druids: runes and tree-lore). Venturing into dangerous or foreign territory. The entrance to the personal unconscious, guarded by the censor, who twists unconscious contents into unrecognizable forms. Tendency of rigid mental sets to recreate similar circumstances in objective life. Problem-solving. Arts and entertainment.
