<h2>24 Virgo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A CHILDREN'S BOOK PICTURING MARY AND HER LITTLE LAMB

</p><p class="standard_Q">Child-like innocence and goodness. Lovability. Haven of the innocent heart. Child-like faith and the world it opens up (unwillingness to see life as it is). Holding to the cherished feelings of childhood. Knowledge that the world we feel is the world we inhabit. Cuddliness. Unity of soul and body, heavenly and earthly realities.
