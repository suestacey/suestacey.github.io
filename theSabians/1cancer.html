<h2>1 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">SAILOR HOISTS A NEW FLAG AND CHARTS A NEW COURSE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Embracing a vision of life that has heart. Taking up a more promising course (failing to change a dangerous course of action, and crashing on the rocks; loss of control). Emotional susceptibility: swaying and being swayed (violent mood swings vs. staying on an even keel). Generosity and openness. Emotional karma (kindness is repaid, while nasty secrets allow one's enemies to shoot one down). Embracing a cause. Birth of new collectivities around shared ideals (utopianism); sailing towards the sun. Grounding oneself in one's subjective inner world (confusing reality and fantasy). Smooth translation of ideals into action; romantic embrace of life in all its fullness. Travel.
