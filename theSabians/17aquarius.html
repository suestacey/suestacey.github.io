<h2>17 Aquarius</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A SNARLING DOG GUARDS ITS MASTER'S GOLD

</p><p class="standard_Q">Survival instincts. Looking out for one's own material and spiritual safety. Wariness of hypocrisy and false idealism (cynicism). Liberating oneself and mankind from the control of base instincts so that one can realize higher potentials.  (Gnostic distrust of sexual impulses). (Descent into territorialism, greed, envy, and viciousness). Conquering ego through detachment. Imaginative fancy. Make-believe.
