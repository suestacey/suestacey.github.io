<h2>26 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">AN AFTER-DINNER CONVERSATION IN THE PLUSH LIBRARY OF AN OLD TUDOR MANSION

</p><p class="standard_Q">Cultivated drawing-room conversation. Penetrating observations based on a wealth of knowledge, culture, and worldly experience. Running around and gathering evidence (as in "Clue"). Building an intellectual model that adequately houses the available data (inadequately supported theories). Emergence of a new level of understanding once one has digested earlier facts and theories (conservatism- sticking with a comfortable perspective despite the evidence). Figuring out the complex, interlocking relationships of society. Critiquing society's structural ills. Rhetorical skill. Practiced delivery. Bibliophiles (romances; whodunits). Sniffing out a rat. Detective work.
