<h2>12 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">IN A MAGICAL GROVE HUNG WITH JAPANESE LANTERNS, FAIRIES AND SPRITES ARE GRACEFULLY DANCING

</p><p class="standard_Q">Developing a fascinating, magical persona that invites the projections of others. Extravagant self-expression. Living in the public eye (self-conscious, retiring). The child's confident knowledge of his own essential nature, which allows him the freedom to play with different personas. Imaginative play. Fairyland as the timeless magical world of childhood (refuse to grow up; only play at being adults). Chummy egalitarianism of the playground. Skeptical attitude towards sex roles (sexual fascination: project a timeless beauty onto the beloved, giving cosmic import to their every move). Boundlessness of reality. Immanence of God in nature. Attuned to pagan nature spirits. Dancing and festivities.
