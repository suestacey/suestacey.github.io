<h2>23 Aquarius</h2>
<p class="standard_M"> A TRAINED BEAR WAVES ITS ARMS AND LEGS AS IT ATTEMPTS TO BALANCE ON A HUGE, SLOWLY ROTATING CHAIR

</p><p class="standard_Q">The Little Bear of Little Dipper, which appears to stir the heavens. Attempt to achieve a rational balance, and to move the world according to one's will. Responsibility of political power (ruthless decisiveness). Achieving a global perspective. Commentary. Crazy antics and clowning.
