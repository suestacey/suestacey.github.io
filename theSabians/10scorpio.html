<h2>10 Scorpio</h2>
<p class="standard_M">DINNER AT A BEAUTIFUL OLD HOME. THE FATHER SAYS A PRAYER AND BREAKS BREAD.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Thankfulness for material plenty and the emotional, familial, and political stability it upholds. Old values preserved and passed on (hypocritically preserving external facades while sacrificing inner content). Forging group bonds through ritual. Communion. God as the ultimate giver and the ultimate receiver.
