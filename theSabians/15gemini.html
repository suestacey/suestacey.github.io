<h2>15 Gemini</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A DUTCH CHILD AND AN INDONESIAN CHILD PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER OVER A CHINESE PUZZLE BOX

</p><p class="standard_Q">Give and take. Teamwork. Teaching and being taught. Compensating for a partner's weak points or blind spots. Getting a fresh take on a problem from an outside source (stymied). Finishing with a problem and returning to an alert, receptive state. Incongruities that suggest one's views need to be re-examined. Learning to distinguish reality from false constructs. Striving for a more conscious understanding of symbolic truths. Putting mental imagery into concrete artistic form, so one can get a better grasp of it. Arriving at new levels of understanding. Gravitating towards experiences appropriate to one's developmental level. Pondering over the human dilemma. Working together for a better  world. Simple-hearted helpfulness. Friendship.
