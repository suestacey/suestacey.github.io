<h2>29 Aries</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A CELESTIAL CHOIR HAS ARISEN TO SING COSMIC HARMONIES

</p><p class="standard_Q">The music of the spheres. Rarefied, 'stratospheric' harmony that penetrates the universe. At-onement with all the forces impinging on the present moment. Operating within seeming chaos and bringing out its underlying meaning and harmony (collapse into cacophonous fragmentation). Synchronicity. Discovering individual destiny in the larger pattern of events. Impact.
