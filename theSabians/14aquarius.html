<h2>14 Aquarius</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A CHAMELEON LOOKING UP THROUGH HIS BURROW TOWARDS THE SUN

</p><p class="standard_Q">The retina. Passively registering one's situation. Puzzled detachment from the common reality assumptions of society. Exploring and connecting different perspectives or levels of consciousness. Tight squeezes: the need to rid oneself of intellectual and behavioral baggage in radically new situations. Forgetfulness of the spirit in between incarnations. Slippery, deceptive persona. Orientation through star sightings.
