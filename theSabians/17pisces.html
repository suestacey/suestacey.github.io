<h2>17 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A MAN PUSHES TO THE FRONT OF A CROWD AND DELIVERS A PASSIONATE SPEECH ON BEHALF OF THE POOR

</p><p class="standard_Q">Self-appointed representatives of the public welfare: arguing point for point in the courts, on the streets, in public institutions, or on the battlefield (resort to violence). Pugnacious individuals who take no guff. High-profile champions of the underdog. Demand to be taken on their own terms, but also recognize the need for cooperation. Joining head and heart, passion and reason in social movements. Mobilizing around group needs. Throwing oneself into a cause, or putzing around on the fringe through a failure of resolve or a fear of being lost in the crowd. Group solidarity vs. conflicts of interest. Retaining primary allegiances vs. selling out (tactical concessions to popular tastes).
