<h2>4 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">GUEST SPEAKER AT A PRESTIGIOUS ANTHROPOLOGISTS' CLUB GRABS A TOP HAT FROM A HAT RACK AND WITTILY PRONOUNCES ON THE PRETENSIONS AND STATUS OF ITS OWNER

</p><p class="standard_Q">Keen observation. Dissecting human behavior and culture. Learning cultural formulas and rituals inside-out (social polish vs. insincere manipulativeness). Promoting social evolution through a playful but acid-tongued criticism of social hypocrisy. Balancing the mind with the heart vs. relentlessly pushing a point (disgruntled sense of being head and shoulders above the opposition). Exposing the game vs. playing the game. Sticking to one's guns, but retaining society's good graces by pulling the right strings. Studying primitive man and his myths. Ministering to the human longing for freedom and higher consciousness without succumbing to religious claptrap. Impish genius.
