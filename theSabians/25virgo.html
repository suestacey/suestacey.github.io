<h2>25 Virgo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A SIMPLE TESTIMONIAL GIVEN AT A WAR-TIME FUNERAL, BEFORE THE GUNS ARE PICKED UP ONCE MORE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Giving testimony to the truth. Life viewed as a plain and simple gift which must be Â honored and respected (pacifism). Inevitable judgment at the end of life: honest self-appraisal (blindness to one's own gifts). Objective appraisal of character. Truthfulness.
