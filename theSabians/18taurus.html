<h2>18 Taurus</h2>
<p class="standard_M">POPULIST LEADER HANGS THE PARTY BANNER FROM HIS HEADQUARTERS' WINDOW, TO THE CHEERS OF THE CROWD BELOW.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Serving as the symbolic focus for some political or cultural movement. Providing new direction and new hope. The power of faith to move mountains (seducing people with pipe dreams, or angry denunciations of such misrepresentations). Resolution to materialize one's ideals (blowhards). Popular agitation. Oratory. Grassroots organizing. Forging alliances. Gathering steam. Gathering followers and leaving for the promised land. Finding the right soil in which to plant one's dreams (false starts). Overthrowing the musty oppressiveness of the old order. Opening a window to a bright new tomorrow. Spring cleaning on a grand scale.
