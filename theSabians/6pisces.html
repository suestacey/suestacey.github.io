<h2>6 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">WEST POINT CADETS, SHOULDERING GUNS ARMED WITH BAYONETS, MARCH AND COUNTER MARCH IN THE RED SETTING SUN

</p><p class="standard_Q">Subordinating personal will to group goals. Mediating disputes within one's group. Promoting "tightness" and teamwork (lockstep conformity). Insightful and penetrating analysis of major social problems. Arguing problems through point by point to arrive at a deeper consensus. The changing of the guard: conflict between the old and the new. Open challenges to the existing order. Virile pride (thorny contentiousness; wounded pride). Battle for dominance between individuals or groups, from the friendly rivalry of sports to the cruelty of war.
