<h2>27 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">IN THE EAST, LIGHT SLOWLY INCREASES, WIPING OUT THE STARS

</p><p class="standard_Q">Making a forceful, confident personal statement (being "hip"). Certainty of belief. A mind consumed in dedication to its ideals. Incendiaries- getting one's ideas to catch on. Desire for total victory over opposing points of view (scattering or erasing the opponent's influence). Clear view of the political and cultural landscape. Expanding one's realm of control, either territorially or intellectually. Controlling social change by controlling the purse strings (spendthrifts). Long range vs. short range investments (spending on forms of immediate gratification). Argumentative (twist things around). On a slow burn. Dangerous when their fuse is lit. The mind consumed in devotion to the ideal. Funneling every new element of existence towards one's vision of the future (destruction or eclipsing of lesser or opposing points of view). Assurance. Dedication. The authority of the visionary (fanaticism). Leadership.
