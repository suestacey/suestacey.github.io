<h2>7 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">FOG HIDES THE SHORE, BUT ON A SUNLIT ISLAND A CROSS SHINES FROM THE GLOOM

</p><p class="standard_Q">Renouncing the confusing mists of worldly passion, and centering oneself within the clarity of transpersonal love. Emotional stability founded upon the rock of faith. Reaching out to others and offering love and understanding: safe harbor from the storms of life. Purifying the emotions from selfish passions. Figuring out what makes people tick (manipulative head trips, religious cults). Storytellers: stringing people along with amusing tales. The world as illusion. Patient acceptance of worldly suffering (martyr complex). Healing illumination following periods of darkness and suffering. Spiritual transcendence.
