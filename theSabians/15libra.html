<h2>15 Libra</h2>
<p class="standard_M">CAPTAIN OF A PADDLE WHEELER STEERS INTO OPEN WATER

</p><p class="standard_Q">Sure sense of direction. Big plans. Opportunism. Attracting opportunities by making a good impression. Finding points of contact with others without making compromises  (steeled against outside influence). The individual as a microcosm of his society. Self-consistent set of opinions grounded in personal experience and observation. Decisions  based on an understanding of all the angles (indecisiveness).
