<h2>4 Scorpio</h2>
<p class="standard_M">YOUTH CARRIES A LIT CANDLE IN HIS FIRST CHURCH SERVICE

</p><p class="standard_Q">The body as a temple housing the all-penetrating light of the spirit. The sense of being trapped in the body: morbid fears. Searching for moral confirmation from within one's own soul. Introspection. Self-purification. Spiritual crisis. Reverence for life. The astral light.
