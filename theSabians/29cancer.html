<h2>29 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A JUDGE PEERS OVER THE SCALES OF JUSTICE AS THE ATTORNEY FOR THE DEFENSE BEGINS HIS REBUTTAL

</p><p class="standard_Q">Intellectual sparring. Penetrating questions and quick retorts. Defending one's position. Refocusing public debate. Championing an oppositional viewpoint (heroes of the counterculture). Gaining a voice vs. being silenced. Pressing one's advantage vs. backing away from unproductive arguments (withdrawing from life's vicissitudes and spiritually re-centering). Life hanging in the balance. Seizing one's destiny by acting with decisiveness and courage at life's crossroads. Mounting a campaign. Risky ventures (highly publicized death). Emotional appeals. Teaching a simplified version of the truth (good sense of audience). Tracing causes and effects. Getting to the central point of an issue.
