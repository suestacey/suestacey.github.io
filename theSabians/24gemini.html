<h2>24 Gemini</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A WOMAN FIGURE-SKATING ON A SMOOTHLY FROZEN POND. ON THE SIDELINES AN ARTIST PREPARES TO SKETCH THE SCENE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Open-endedness of reality. Reality as the interface between what one sees, and the pattern of meaning one imposes on events. Spiraling in on mysterious meanings. Provocative and culturally potent new interpretations. Putting an interesting spin on things (playful interactions; word play). Artistic self-expression. Communicating subjective impressions through conversation, art, or poetry (perfecting a skill). Cautiously testing out some new possibility vs. boldly sallying forth in spite of a lack of firm grounding (skating on thin ice vs. getting tangled up in negative anticipations). Romantic mavericks who live within a self-created mythology. Revealing hidden patterns.
