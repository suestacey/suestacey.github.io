<h2>1 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">BLOOD RUSHING TO HIS HEAD, A VERY SMALL BUT VERY ANGRY MAN IS ROLLING UP HIS SLEEVES

</p><p class="standard_Q">Righteous resolve. Fighting for personal prerogatives. Choosing one's turf and dominating the field. Ignoring naysayers and going after one's goals and desires (try to stop me). Upping the ante. Challenging oneself (courting danger). Mastering one's passions vs. losing one's head. Feeling sexually aroused, and deciding what to do about it. Compensating weaknesses with strengths. Banking on raw animal passion. Drawing an opponent into battle, then blasting him away or jumping down his throat (shameless bullying, temper tantrums). Down and dirty approach to life. Making a scene one's own. Exaggerated personal style (fauvism). Courageously speaking one's mind.
