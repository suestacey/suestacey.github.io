<h2>11 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GIRL, LIT BY A SUNBEAM, SWINGS UNDER THE BRANCH OF AN ANCIENT OAK. A SATYR CROUCHES BY A DOOR IN THE BASE OF THE TREE.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Brightness and precocity. Preserving the communion with nature one enjoyed as a child. Protecting the innocence of childhood (unseen dangers; ambush). Rooting out hidden, corruptive influences. Vigilance and vigilantes (judgmental ideologues). Spiraling back through the door of memory. Backward-looking mind, looking towards a mythic golden age. Building new institutions on refashioned foundations. Deferring to established authority vs. figuring things out for oneself (inventive, but deaf to outside input). Holding to the presumed safety of the past vs. venturing forth into an uncertain future (disoriented, overwhelmed). Hiding from fears vs. opening up to the easy rhythm of natural living.
