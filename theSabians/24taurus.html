<h2>24 Taurus</h2>
<p class="standard_M">RIDING THE WAVES AT MAVERICKS

</p><p class="standard_Q">Developing physical and psychosexual confidence. Facing one's fears. Getting important experiences under one's belt (frightened retreat). Plutonic initiations. Journeys to the underworld. Demythologizing one's fears (retreat into a labyrinthine fantasy life). Physical life as the lens through which all the images of the psyche must either find expression, or be cast into the subconscious (perverse championing of shadowy potencies). Tapping the polytheistic energies of the subconscious through imagination. Full command of psychological resources. Reliance on inner resources. Street-smarts (lawless, violent). Natural vs. human law. Mavericks and demimondaines. Individual potency.
