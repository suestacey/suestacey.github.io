<h2>24 Capricorn</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A NUN WALKING THROUGH A FIELD OF WILD LILIES TOWARDS THE BRICK WALLS OF A CONVENT

</p><p class="standard_Q">Finding a haven from the world where one can cultivate the inner garden of the soul. Renunciation of worldly desires. Entrance into the inner garden of the soul. Quiet spiritual life. Gentleness. Calm resolve to abide by the decisions of the spirit. The firm but gentle hand that leads the soul out of the difficulties of the world.
