<h2>3 Virgo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A SHINING ANGEL HOVERS PROTECTIVELY OVER A NAKED COUPLE LOST IN THE WILDERNESS

</p><p class="standard_Q">Living into one's spiritual ideals. Protection which comes to those on the spiritual path (awareness of one's vulnerability to earthly snares). Guidance by the unclouded eyes of the higher Self, especially in love. Spiritual ideals passed from one generation to the next. Hopefulness.
