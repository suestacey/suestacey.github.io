<h2>12 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A WOMAN NURSING A BABY HALOED BY DIVINE LIGHT

</p><p class="standard_Q">Guardianship. The Divine Mother. Transpersonal love that watches over the larger whole: the family, the nation, and even nature. Protecting one's spiritual innocence in spite of disillusioning experiences. Clarifying spiritual and moral issues. Tenderly nurturing people's divine potentials. Slow penetration of the human by the divine. Forbearance towards those who are not as far on the path vs. lashing out at their short-sightedness (worriers; exasperated by the public's unconsciousness). Fighting for one's beliefs vs. putting the situation in the hands of God. Theosophy: illuminating inner mysteries. Faith in higher powers. Praying for guidance. The star Sirius.
