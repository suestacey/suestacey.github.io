<h2>18 Virgo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A MAN AND A WOMAN START UP A CONVERSATION OVER THEIR NEWSPAPERS

</p><p class="standard_Q">Seeking experiential proof of one's hunches (social gaffes). Being attuned to subtle, sometimes subconscious clues, to what is happening behind the social facade. Getting beyond the surface and initiating a relationship. Fumbling around before one finds the right words. Ignoring unstated social rules. Discovering one's own limits. Challenging one's fears. Romantic adventurousness.
