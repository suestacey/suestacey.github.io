<h2>21 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">DRUNKEN CHICKENS MAKE DIZZYING ATTEMPTS TO FLY

</p><p class="standard_Q">Silly antics to lighten things up. Humor. Momentarily attaining a higher state of consciousness through drugs or alcohol. Chicken-brained ridiculousness of human behavior as seen from a higher perspective. Cultural criticism. Pointing to discrepancies between actions and ideals (moralizing). Mindfulness. Getting down to business vs. hanging out with old friends. Gaining a sane perspective: not taking oneself too lightly, or too seriously. Doing one's bit for society, or blowing off steam for the fun of it. Balancing goals with abilities. Having the courage to risk failure or humiliation in some new venture (chickening out). Stray insights from a higher plane. Serious zaniness.
