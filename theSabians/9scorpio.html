<h2>9 Scorpio</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A DENTIST DRILLING DECAYED TEETH

</p><p class="standard_Q">The need to look at the bad side of things in order to rectify them. Outspoken social criticism (afraid to participate unconditionally in life). Fearless exposure of evil. Developing healthy thought patterns and mental discipline--or slipping into anxiety vortexes. Conquering self-indulgence and ego-related fears.
