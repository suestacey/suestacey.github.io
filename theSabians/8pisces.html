<h2>8 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A BUGLER GREETS THE RISING SUN

</p><p class="standard_Q">Bringing hidden truths to the light of day. Opening up public discussion (using humor to take the edge off uncomfortable truths). Subconsciously recognized truths that enjoy immediate recognition and assent. Bursting onto the scene as a mature talent. Developing some claim to fame that will allow one to enter into the public arena (premature and unconvincing demands for deference). Tooting one's own horn. Developing and living into a public persona. Watching the horizon between conscious and subconscious thought. Channeling the wisdom of the subconscious (occult and spiritual insight). Awakening dormant cultural forces. Promotion of some new truth, or mere self-promotion.
