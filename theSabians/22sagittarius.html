<h2>22 Sagittarius</h2>
<p class="standard_M">JEHOVAH, LOOKING DOWN ON THE EARTH FROM HIS HEAVENLY THRONE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Divine justice. Life as a test: a morality play. Judgment visited on humanity (divine wrath). Pitting oneself against the fallacies of public opinion. Spurring humanity onwards and upwards. Heroic sentiment. Teaching by example. Zeus or Jupiter. (Self) righteousness.
