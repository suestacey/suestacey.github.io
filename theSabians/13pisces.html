<h2>13 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">ANGRY WORKER, WAVING HIS FIST, INTERRUPTS A HYPOCRITICAL SPEECH AT A POLITICAL FUNDRAISER

</p><p class="standard_Q">Protecting one's personal rights from the encroachment of society and its apologists, including one's family. Refusing to hide behind social norms (defiant, disobedient, tantrum-throwers). Cutting through the bullshit. Unasked for opinions- belaboring others with one's point of view. Fighting for psychological space. Being completely true to one's perceptions. Artistic and literary inspiration drawn from a life fully lived. Raw, passionate living (coarse, dissolute). Going after what one wants (selfish, unscrupulous, physical or intellectual intimidation). Having the courage to fight for truth and justice in everyday situations. Holding oneself to one's own high standards of truth.
