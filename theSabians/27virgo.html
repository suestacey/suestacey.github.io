<h2>27 Virgo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">AN ELDERLY WOMAN POURS TEA FOR FAMILY MEMBERS AND GUESTS

</p><p class="standard_Q">Cultural preservation or break with the past. Mature and refined cultural sensibilities inherited from the previous generation (getting stuck in the thoughts and habits of one's parents). Keeping social energies flowing. Patching up differences. Generous bridging of social chasms, or the emotional and material miserliness that comes from keeping scorecards. Tikkun. Desire for stable and orderly surroundings.
