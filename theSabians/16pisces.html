<h2>16 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A MAN STROLLING IN THE WOODS COMES UPON A GROUP OF SINGING GYPSIES. OFFERED A GOBLET OF WINE, HE PROPOSES A TOAST.

</p><p class="standard_Q">The Holy Grail: symbol of the purified heart and the universal life-blood it contains. Deep emotions which resonate with the whole of life. Sincere effort to make emotional connections (hidden agendas). Winning people over. Seeing clearly into the human heart. Dissolving mutual suspicions (diplomatic caution). Self-containment vs spilling one's guts. Portioning out what is appropriate. Questions of loyalties. Recalling one's higher purpose vs. forgetting oneself. Putting humanity first. Global, utopian visions (pipe dreams). Life's "high notes". Reaching for the inspiration of the Muse. Music and dance (drunken carousing). Succoring the heart. Overflowing compassion.
