<h2>23 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A WRITERS GROUP DISCUSSING THEIR LATEST NOVELS

</p><p class="standard_Q">Developing a unique artistic style or world view. Collecting facts and experiences that fit into one's aesthetic (the Moon as net or strainer; odd mixtures of fact and fiction). Balancing sun and moon: perception and interpretation. Disputes over interpretation. Being pushed aside vs. clamoring to be heard (bad listeners). Renegotiating relationships. Learning to work as a team without giving up personal rights (artistic duos; unusual  lovers). Complicated social rituals binding groups together (touchstones of in-group, out- group behavior). Balancing male and female traits in the personality. Emotional self- sufficiency (self-involved). Winning legitimacy for a new cultural form. Unique cultural  statements (off-color Bohemianism).
