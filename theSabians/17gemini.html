<h2>17 Gemini</h2>
<p class="standard_M">HEAD OF A YOUTH CHANGES INTO THAT OF A MATURE THINKER

</p><p class="standard_Q">Cultivating positive personality traits, and rooting out negative ones before they blossom into full expression. Wheat and tares. Conflict between generations as the young mature and become morally independent (protracted adolescent rebellion). Moral and intellectual integrity. Bearing witness. Jack-in-the-Beanstalk archetype (magic seeds, rapid growth, oedipal conflict).
