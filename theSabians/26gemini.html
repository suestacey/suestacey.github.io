<h2>26 Gemini</h2>
<p class="standard_M">FROST-COVERED TREES AGAINST CLEAR BLUE SKIES

</p><p class="standard_Q">Overwhelming awe in the face of the cosmic mystery. Seeing archetypal or symbolic resonances in everyday life. Glimpsing magical patterns. Crystallizing deeper truths from one's experience. Developing a fixed analysis (attempts to impose one's ideology; bearish, argumentative; don't listen). Turning inwards after worldly defeats (alienated). Reigning over a private inner world, as individualistic as a snowflake. Deeply personal poetic vision (melancholy). Bearing witness to neglected truths. Coaxing others to open to the spiritual mysteries of life. Telling paradigmatic stories (magical lines of force in fairy tales). Nature as a timeless and eternal kingdom, whose transient external forms are built up on timeless archetypes. The crown chakra.
