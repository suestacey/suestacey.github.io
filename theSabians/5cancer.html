<h2>5 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">HITTING THE ACCELERATOR, A TEENAGER IN A SOUPED-UP CONVERTIBLE RACES THE TRAIN TO THE CROSSROADS

</p><p class="standard_Q">Suffering boredom vs. creating a happening scene. Making one's own music (bar scenes; cultivated vulgarity). Bringing new energies to an established scene (partycrashers). Breaking the mold by one's very presence. Tours de forces. Stunts. Getting away with something (attention-seeking). Instant analysis and rapid decision-making that makes the crucial difference when a situation is in spin. Being able to handle any situation that comes up. Living in the moment but anticipating outcomes. Good sense of timing. Reckless attempts to rectify social injustice. Going outside established channels and risking the consequences. Quick sprints. Physical exertion.
