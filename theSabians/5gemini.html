<p class="standard_M">A MAN HAWKING A SELF-PUBLISHED RADICAL MAGAZINE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Having something important to say. Putting one's message in a catchy, original form. Slipping important messages into humor. Crazy wisdom). Catalyzing social change by shifting the ground of public discussion (revolutionaries). Waking people up by presenting reality in a startling light (shock tactics or fear tactics). Faith in direct perception. Living with few assumptions (constantly amazed by life's surprises). Jauntily dancing within a situation in spin. Keeping one's edge vs. relying on proven formulas. Staying true to one's viewpoint vs. selling out. Knowing when to earnestly argue a case, and when to goof around. Developing a trademark style. Self-advertising.
