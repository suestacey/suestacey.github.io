<h2>18 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A HEN SCRATCHING FOR HER CHICKS

</p><p class="standard_Q">Providing spiritual and emotional nourishment. Cultural offerings. Helpfulness (officiousness). Making up stories (Mother Goose). Rich imaginative life. Cock-eyed look at human behavior. Seeing the shadow-side. The outsider's perspective (anthropology). Odd ducks. Shy fretfulness vs. being at home with oneself. Being bound by instinct, heredity, and social expectation vs. giving expression to surprising potentials. Innocently bopping through life. Trusting fate to lead one along life's twisting path (meeting the unexpected). Getting at deeper meanings by intuitive brooding (convoluted logic; getting all the evidence to fit). Enjoying both the weird and the commonplace. Droll humor (morbid).
