<h2>6 Taurus</h2>
<p class="standard_M">IN AN OPENING CEREMONY, THE MAYOR TIES THE RIBBON THAT SYMBOLICALLY COMPLETES A CANTILEVERED BRIDGE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Bridging the emotional chasm between people. Eliciting affection. Charming, entertaining, modest behavior that affords one entrance into polite society. Ability to find common ground and thus to move easily between social circles. Packaging one's talents in an attractive, accessible way (slick; technically facile). Having one's act together. Completing one's personality to the finest details (lightly mocking parody). Delighting in small tokens and graceful social forms. Playfulness. Effervescence. Lightness of touch. Wit. Composition in architecture, music, and art (atomic composition in science). Appreciating the beauty of nature and art. Making life enjoyable.
