<h2>17 Scorpio</h2>
<p class="standard_M">ST. GEORGE APPROACHES THE DRAGON'S CAVE. CLOSE BY A PREGNANT WOMAN LOOKS CALMLY TOWARDS THE CITY.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Powerful urge to see things according to a static inner model, or dreamers with a new vision of reality. Deference to timeless inner values that are antecedent to physical reality. Resistance to change, especially worldly corruption. Working on society from within (assimilated and corrupted by dark forces).
