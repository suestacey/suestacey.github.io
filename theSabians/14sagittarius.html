<h2>14 Sagittarius</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A TOURIST AND AN EGYPTIAN TOUR GUIDE ARGUE IN FRONT OF THE PYRAMIDS

</p><p class="standard_Q">The meeting of two cultures or two perspectives. Stability of a society's fundamental beliefs grounded in its unique experience of time. Superficiality of concessions to converging cultures. Getting beyond the maze of one's own cultural matrix. Two-sided personality: in-group and out-group, public and private. Memory.
