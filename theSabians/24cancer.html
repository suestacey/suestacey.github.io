<h2>24 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">TWO MEN AND A WOMAN PLAYING CARDS ON THE VERANDA OF A SOUTH SEA ISLAND RESORT

</p><p class="standard_Q">Harmony. Trying to arrive at an ideal within one's relationships (complications arising from the betrayal of ideals; triangles; delicate emotional balancing acts). Maintaining the peace by playing one's cards close to the chest. Guarding one's options. Expedient action (playing people against each other; sexual games; office politics; scoring contacts). Visionary beauty of nature vs. dangers of the jungle. False paradises (Adam, Eve, and the Serpent). Knowledge as power: occultism or James Bond style espionage. Keeping a calm surface while attending to underlying dangers vs. sacrificing inner values to maintain external forms. Healthy recreation vs. vices of the idle rich.
