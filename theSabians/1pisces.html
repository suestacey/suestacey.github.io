<h2>1 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">BEAUTIFUL SENORITA, FAN IN HAND, BANTERS WITH THE GROCER WHILE TESTING THE PRODUCE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Subtle negotiations in human relationships. The role of conversation in veiling or revealing one's true thoughts and feelings. Repartee and gossip. Testing for substantiality beneath physical beauty (artifices of fashion). Aggressive modernity. Bringing one's ideals into everyday life. Living in the present, with all its choices. Drawing back or plunging into some bold new adventure. Discretion vs. indiscretion. Public vs. private reality. Attracting love through a projected image of beauty, but fighting against the presumption that the image is the reality. Defending one's psychological space. Realistic appraisal within the sexual marketplace. Literary ability. The Muse.
