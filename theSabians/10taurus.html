<h2>10 Taurus</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A RED CROSS NURSE CALLING FOR HELP ON THE BATTLEFIELD, A BLEEDING SOLDIER AT THEIR FEET.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Rousing oneself or others to deal with a difficult and pressing problem (complacency  and denial). Plunging into the fray, or resting idly within unattained ideals. Dispelling factional strife by underscoring common concerns. Speaking for a constituency. Oratorical power (sounding off; boastful provocation). Breaking tabus in order to draw attention to one's cause. Braving social criticism in high-visibility positions. Cutting to the heart of a situation through empathetic understanding. Sensitivity to emotional and physical distress (emotional retaliation; violent and sadistic impulses). Reading people's hearts. Having the heart to care. Healing. Moral leadership.
