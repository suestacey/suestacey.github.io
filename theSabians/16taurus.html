<h2>16 Taurus</h2>
<p class="standard_M">OLD MAN TRIES HARD TO IMPART TRUTHS TO A CROWD

</p><p class="standard_Q">Integrity. Embodying one's ideals in one's life. Teaching through example. Non-verbal expression: affect people through sheer presence. Form and symbol as a primitive universal language. Emergence of individual will and thought from mass consciousness. Folk heroes who are strong individuals, but can still speak for the common folk. Broad  popular appeal. Remaining accessible, but maintaining the purity of one's vision. Home-spun philosophy vs. telling people what they want to hear (pre-digested truths verging on  bullshit). Insistent expression of heart-felt emotions. Awakening an emotional response. Ministering to the spiritual and emotional needs of humanity. Poetry, art, and music.
