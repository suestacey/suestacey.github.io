<h2>17 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">MISSIONARY LEADS A BAND OF SETTLERS UP-RIVER, THROUGH THE STEAMING JUNGLE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Taking responsibility for the evolution of one's culture towards its ideals. Passionate demand that social institutions conform to ideals of humanity and justice. Gathering patrons and supporters. Charting a course that takes account of many complex factors. Embodying one's country's ideals overseas (entering enemy territory; plots; paramilitary teamwork). Delighting in a self-created mythic persona (carried away by their fantasies; self-created dire situations). Heading up a new cultural or artistic impulse (revivifying the vital spirit of a former age). Raising people's spirits through imaginative or musical offerings. Pioneers and reformers. Living up to ideals.
