<h2>25 Gemini</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A GARDENER, WEARING A LOUD HAWAIIAN SHIRT AND HOLDING A PAIR OF SHEERS, LOOKS OUT FROM UNDER A FANTASTICALLY TRIMMED PALM TREE.

</p><p class="standard_Q">Exaggerating the essential features of one's personality. Paring away non-essentials. Cutting a figure (silly posturing or get-ups). Revealing the most important features of a situation by peeling away the 'bull'. Playing it as one sees it. Refusing to recognize any world other than the world one knows (obtuse literalness vs. cutting through surface appearances). Appreciating the existential craziness of life. Improvisational play. Keeping one's cool in chaotic situations. Bringing extreme situations back to a civilized state (impose their own rules on the game). Getting the jump on one's enemies. Nipping problems in the bud. Heroic efforts on behalf of the life force. Self-maintenance. Staying physically fit by staying in the action. Gusto.
