<h2>7 Virgo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">BRIGHT-EYED WOMEN LAUGH HAPPILY IN A PALATIAL HAREM

</p><p class="standard_Q">The beehive, the ruby ring, the pomegranate: jewel-like beauty of soul which is reflected in outer beauty. Outer beauty can be traded off for worldly comfort, or remain firm and chaste in its emotional and spiritual loyalties. Capacity for refined love, or shy withdrawal behind personality screens. Eloquent expressiveness. Intimacy. Emotional discretion.
