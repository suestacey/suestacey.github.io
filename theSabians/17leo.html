<h2>17 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">JOHN THE BAPTIST PREACHES WHILE SALOME DANCES

</p><p class="standard_Q">Lending a strong voice to the hopes, dreams, and desires of the people. Leading the people towards spiritual and cultural regeneration. Winning over the crowd (charging  up the troops by demonizing the opposition). Inspired rants. Keeping reason and sensuality within their proper bounds vs. letting either ideology or passion run away with you. Giving oneself over to a temptress or a charismatic leader. Keeping it together vs. losing one's head (madness; violent denouements). Trusting one's impulses. Going after what one wants (debauched). Confidently pursuing a personal ethic or aesthetic (lawless, Bohemian). Embracing the poetry and eroticism of life, the new and untried. Leaving options open. Dance of the seven veils. Dionysian mysteries.
