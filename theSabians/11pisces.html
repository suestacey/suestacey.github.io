<h2>11 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A GIRL LOOKS UP FROM HER POETRY TO SEE THE BOY NEXT DOOR ENTERING HER YARD BY JUMPING OVER A THORNY HEDGE AND WALKING UNDER AN ARCHWAY OF ROSES

</p><p class="standard_Q">Longing for emotional union and completion: the anima or animus leading one into romantic adventure. Hanging around, hedged in by repressive social conventions, vs. jumping the fence and entering into some new adventure. Tom-Sawyerism. Cherishing familiar people and places. Group loyalties of the playground or the family. Perennial nature of old friendships. Romantic idealism vs. the cynical savvy of the emotionally wounded. Impressionability of the soul to beauty. Internalizing experience in poetry and literature. Sharing one's opinions. Unmediated first impressions. Honesty and responsiveness (sniping criticism). New perspectives that open up new directions in life. Romanticism.
