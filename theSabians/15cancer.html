<h2>15 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">FAT, SMILING CHEF PRESENTS A HUGE SUCKLING PIG AT AN EXTRAVAGANT FEAST

</p><p class="standard_Q">Luxuriant wallowing in sensual delights (gluttony, excess). Taking what one wants from life (immoral schemes: adultery, theft, fraud). Enjoying common pleasures: food, sex, sleep, conversation. The moon's role in compensating needs. Seeking approval. Winning wide popularity for one's public persona, but feeling like an ugly duckling underneath (Glowering jealousy. Secret vices. Amorous or political intrigues). Pushing wishful thinking as far as reality will allow. Playing around in a fantasy world (Candyland). Maintaining helpful illusions. Fairy godmothers who try to make children's wishes come true. Producing something for public enjoyment. Emotional generosity. Hospitality.
