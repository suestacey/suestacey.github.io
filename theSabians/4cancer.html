<h2>4 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A CAT IN A LION'S CAGE, PLAYING WITH THE LION'S TAIL

</p><p class="standard_Q">Playfulness. Creating and living within one's own imaginative world. Believing one's own stories (inner representations as reality). Uniqueness of viewpoint. Refusing to be pinned down or second-guessed. Imperviousness to social expectations (brazen posturing; ungongable). Smooth operators (Puss and Boots; opening doors through charm). Refreshing honesty. Penetrating to a new emotional level (gaining the psychological advantage). Sparring. Wars of nerves (sadistic). Entering into other people's consciousness through empathy. Pinning down one's suspicions through emotional and intellectual probing (making trouble). Weird, whimsical musings. Seizing the imagination of the public.
