<h2>11 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A WOMAN MODERATES AN EMOTIONAL DISCUSSION AT THE DINNER TABLE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Engaging others emotionally and intellectually. Honest communication (overly blunt). Trying to win an argument without sacrificing the emotional harmony of the group (jokers who need to get in the last word). Factoring in the characters of the people one is talking to. Seeing beyond social masks and listening with the heart. Recognizing the universal need for love and respect. Setting the terms of public debate by taking an extreme position. Upping the emotional ante, or using humor to lighten things up. Confrontation, polarization. Getting people to respond in the way one wants. Public forums (debased discourse of the mass media). Bringing drama to everyday life. Expressiveness (moodiness).
