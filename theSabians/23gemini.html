<h2>23 Gemini</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A ROWDY, TALKATIVE CROWD IN A SEASIDE TAVERN; A PERFORMER IS TRYING TO GET THEIR ATTENTION

</p><p class="standard_Q">Sociability (attract selfish or idealistic people according to their own natures). Multiplying one's influence through social contacts. Getting into the thick of things. Holding one's own in a rude, uncivilized world. Rakes and vamps. Wearing one's heart on one's sleeve (charming propositions vs. coy seduction). Courageously facing horrible social or political problems. Telling it like it is. Uniting and voicing the will of the people. Political demonstrations (riots). Irrepressibility. No permission needed. Reaching a higher synthesis through argument (verbally combative). The higher self as the mediator of different voices in the personality. Maintaining a calm, uncluttered perspective in the midst of total confusion. Friendly egalitarianism vs. egoism.
