<h2>1 Taurus</h2>
<p class="standard_M">HIGH ABOVE AN INDUSTRIAL MILL-TOWN, A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN BATHES IN A CLEAR MOUNTAIN STREAM

</p><p class="standard_Q">Natural beauty. Passionate living. Plunging fearlessly into life. Seeking out experiences that will help one grow. Trusting one's instinctive responses: gathering in what is wholesome, and expelling what is ugly or corrupt. Confidence in one's powers and opinions. Holding to one's deepest values in one's turbulent journey through life (troubled,  self-absorbed). Taking a stand. Reforming moral corruption that results in social or environmental decay (fanatical purism or puritanism). Thinking things through (heedlessness). Courageous leadership in the realm of aesthetic, moral, or political values. Easy flow of vital energies. Zest for living. Generosity of spirit. Undiluted idealism.
