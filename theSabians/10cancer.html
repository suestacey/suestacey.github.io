<h2>10 Cancer</h2>
<p class="standard_M">AFTER A WALTZ BENEATH THE STARS, A MAN TAKES OUT AN IMPRESSIVE DIAMOND AND PROPOSES TO HIS SWEETHEART

</p><p class="standard_Q">Trying to realize an ideal in human relationships. Protecting the highest image of the soul in oneself and others. Checking infringements on self-respect and human rights. Courtliness: seeing and eliciting the best in others (disappointed in marriage, try to grasp what can't be grasped). Focusing and giving shape to popular ideals. Sharing romance and magic through popular culture. Taking the high road in politics: reason and diplomacy rather than war. Moral resolution and moral leadership. Sure sense of self-worth (stuck on themselves, vain, flashy, high livers). Discovering one's place in the cosmic scheme. Diamonds in the rough. Ideals tested and solidified in life's trials.
