<h2>20 Taurus</h2>
<p class="standard_M">ON A CLOUD-SWEPT HILLTOP, CHILDREN WITH WOODEN SWORDS PLAY AT PIRATES AND TRAVELERS

</p><p class="standard_Q">Cloudlike transience of earthly forms. Life as an illusory dream-play. Refusing to accept society's boring adult games. Creating romantic adventures of one's own, at least in one's imagination. Day dreamers. Rapid coalescence and dispersion of thoughts and feelings (irrationality, confusion). Acting out fantasies in order to get a better grip on them (pained disillusionment). Retaliatory puncturing of illusions (spoilsports, nasty bluntness). Repartee, zingers. Distrust of fixed gender roles. Fluid, playful personality that keeps all options open. Creative development of personal mythology and symbolism. Playing only on one's own terms. Mischievous rebellion.
