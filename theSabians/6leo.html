<h2>6 Leo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">OLD-FASHIONED BELLE AND A FLAPPER EXCHANGE SMILES OF ADMIRATION

</p><p class="standard_Q">Embracing a fresh new attitude towards life. Awakening people to new possibilities. Turning a corner in personal evolution. Going in circles vs. ascending a spiral. Rising above one's immediate social context and seeing oneself in a more cosmic light. Introducing a new stage in historical evolution. Getting across a new awareness in a concentrated but accessible form. Sudden recognition. Passing along the spirit of a bygone age in an  accessible, streamlined form (holding to comfortable old patterns). Achieving self-acceptance and spiritual grace. Tolerant humanitarianism. Changes in external fashions  that help catalyze changes of consciousness (vanity, trendiness). Getting in step with a brand new beat. Changing keys. Harmonious progression.
