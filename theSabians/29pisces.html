<h2>29 Pisces</h2>
<p class="standard_M">ARTIST, DRESSED IN A TURKISH ROBE, PUTS THE FINAL TOUCHES ON A SELF-PORTRAIT, ACCURATE BUT FOR THE KINGLY ATTIRE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Creating a striking personality that closely corresponds to one's inner nature, like a well-tailored suit of clothes (the astral body). Living up to one's spiritually noble interior self. Gaining recognition (Cinderella stories). Reproducing reality in the mind's eye through a careful choice of details (artistic license; flights of fantasy). The imagination's construction of reality from a network of color bits in the retina of the eye. Things coming into focus. Puzzles that need to be methodically pieced together. Prying out necessary details. Pointed interjection of missing information. Puncturing counterfeit images. Dry wit (testy impatience). Accurate representation.
