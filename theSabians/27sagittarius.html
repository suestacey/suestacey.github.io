<h2>27 Sagittarius</h2>
<p class="standard_M">AN ART TEACHER SHOWING A CHILD HOW TO MOLD CLAY POTS

</p><p class="standard_Q">Formative stage of personality. Developing unique creative talents, with some guidance from others (overly pliable, need for seclusion and recentering). Discriminating positive from negative influences. Slow, steady penetration of spirit into matter. Organic evolution. The Creator as sculptor. Remaining loyal to one's own vision of things.
