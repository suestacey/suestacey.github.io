<h2>18 Sagittarius</h2>
<p class="standard_M">TINY CHILDREN IN SUNBONNETS FROLICKING AT THE BEACH

</p><p class="standard_Q">Sense of infantile omnipotence. The creation as the play of God. The magician, as a child, who is playing at the edge of powerful elementals (earth=sand, air=wind, fire=sun, water=ocean). Changing one's situation by giving it little twists and spins. Taking an experimental and experiential approach to life. Cheeky humor.
