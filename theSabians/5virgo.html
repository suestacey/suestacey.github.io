<h2>5 Virgo</h2>
<p class="standard_M">IRISHMAN DREAMS OF "LITTLE PEOPLE" BENEATH AN OLD WILLOW TREE

</p><p class="standard_Q">Collision of expectations and reality: waking up. Maintaining the unconditioned, magical aspect of individuality (childhood), while simultaneously coming to grips with objective conditions (maturity). Fugue of myth and reason. Struggle for freedom through knowledge. Acute socio-political analysis. Moving in and out of focused consciousness.
