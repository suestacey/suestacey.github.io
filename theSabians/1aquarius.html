<h2>1 Aquarius</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A CUBICAL, WHITEWASHED MISSION IN THE DESERT, WITH AN ATTACHED BELL TOWER

</p><p class="standard_Q">Seed groups with a new vision of civilization. The mystic brotherhood. The church without walls. Purity and openness of heart. Esoteric vs. exoteric religion. True Masonry: new reality constructs based on spiritual and natural law. Withdrawing into the soul's inner sanctum to find spiritual revitalization.
