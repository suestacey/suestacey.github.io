<h2>9 Sagittarius</h2>
<p class="standard_M">A MOTHER IS LEADING HER CHILDREN UP A BROAD STAIRWAY

</p><p class="standard_Q">The morning star. Love as a leading light. The journey towards higher levels of consciousness as an open and unobstructed pathway. Alertness to the needs of others, especially children. Education. Teaching people to trust their instinctive pursuit of the good and the beautiful.
