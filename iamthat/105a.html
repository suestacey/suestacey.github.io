<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

</p><p class="standard_MPB">You are led
<br>through your lifetime
<br>by the inner learning creature,
<br>the playful spiritual being
<br>that is your real self.
<br>Don't turn away
<br>from possible futures
<br>before you're certain you don't have
<br>anything to learn from them.
<br>You're always free
<br>to change your mind and
<br>choose a different future, or
<br>a different
<br>past.
