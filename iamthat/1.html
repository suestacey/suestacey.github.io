<h2>The Sense of 'I Am'</h2>
<p class="standard_Q">Q: It is a matter of daily experience that on waking up the world suddenly appears. Where does it come from? 

</p><p class="standard_M">M: Before anything can come into being there must be somebody to whom it comes. All appearance and disappearance presupposes a change against some changeless background. 

</p><br><p class="standard_Q">Q: Before waking up I was unconscious. 

</p><p class="standard_M">M: In what sense? Having forgotten, or not having experienced?Â  Don't you experience even when unconscious? Can you exist without knowing? A lapse in memory: is it a proof of nonexistence? And can you validly talk about your own nonexistence as an actual experience? You cannot even say that your mind did not exist. Did you not wake up on being called? And on waking up, was it not the sense 'I am' that came first? Some seed consciousness must be existing even during sleep, or swoon. On waking up the experience runs: 'I am, the body, in the world.' It may appear to arise in succession but in fact it is all simultaneous, a single idea of having a body in a world. Can there be the sense of 'I am' without being somebody or other?
