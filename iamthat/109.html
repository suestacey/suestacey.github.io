<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

</p><p class="standard_MPB">We are game-playing, fun-having creatures, we are the otters of the universe. We cannot die, we cannot hurt ourselves any more than illusions on the screen can be hurt. But we can believe we're hurt, in whatever agonizing detail we want. We can believe we're victims, being killed and killing, shuddered around by good luck and bad luck.
