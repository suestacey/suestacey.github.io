<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

</p><p class="standard_MPB">We are game-playing,
<br>fun-having creatures,
<br>we are the otters of the universe.
<br>We cannot die, 
<br>we cannot hurt ourselves 
<br>any more than illusions on the screen can be hurt.
<br>But we can believe we're hurt, 
<br>in whatever agonizing detail we want.
<br>We can believe we're victims,
<br>being killed and killing,
<br>shuddered around by good luck
<br>and bad luck.
</p><br>
