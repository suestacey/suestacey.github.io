<h2>Opened Heart / Inner Truth / Inner Sincerity</h2>
</p><p class="standard_M">It is hard to not be largely contained in our small and native worlds. And it is good to enjoy being a pond, or a pool all our own, and to fill up our own little niche with our feelings and meanings. We love the hidden places where our secret selves can go swimming. We have privacy here; we have ways to make our lives feel important; we can be as intense as we want. But wise ones will also sail beyond, when the wind brings good news from the other, and welcome the boat which goes beyond the self, to circulate, to push back those limits and shores and broaden their horizons. When they go hunting and fishing for others, they first seek out the perspective and point of view of the others, if only to find the right trap or bait. The diversity of life begins as close as the family: early in life our young sons and daughters seem to belong to utterly different species. Cross a great stream and ethnocentricity fails; and when we choose to explore a more primitive forest or jungle, even anthropocentrism changes. There are vast realms of beauty here which the human eye cannot see. And yet when we think that dolphins are smart, we're inclined to seek only minds like our own.
