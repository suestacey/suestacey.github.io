<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

</p><p class="standard_M">Where do you learn all this stuff, Don? You know so much, or maybe I just think you do. No. You do know a lot. Is it all practice? Don't you get any formal training to be a Master?"
</p><p class="standard_M">"They give you a book to read."
</p><p class="standard_M">I hung a fresh-washed silk scarf on the flying wires and stared at him. "A book?"
</p><p class="standard_M">"Savior's Manual. It's kind of the bible for masters. There's a copy around here somewhere, if you're interested."
</p><p class="standard_M">"Yes, yes! You mean a regular book that tells you...?"
</p><p class="standard_M">He rummaged around for a while in the baggage space behind the headrest of the Travel Air and came up with a small volume bound in what looked like suede.
</p><br><p class="standard_MPI">Messiah's Handbook,
</p><p class="standard_MPI">Reminders for the Advanced Soul.
</p><p class="standard_M">"What do you mean, Savior's Manual? This says Messiah's Handbook.
</p><p class="standard_M">"Something like that."Â  He started to pick up things around his airplane, as though he thought it was time to be moving on.</p><p class="standard_M">I leafed through the book, a collection of maxims and short paragraphs.
</p><br><p class="standard_MPI">Perspective
</p><p class="standard_MPI">-Use It or Lose It.
</p><p class="standard_MPI">If you turned to this page,
</p><p class="standard_MPI">you're forgetting that what is going
</p><p class="standard_MPI">on around you is not reality.
</p><p class="standard_MPI">Think about that.
</p><p class="standard_MPI">Remember where you came from, 
</p><p class="standard_MPI">where you're going,
</p><p class="standard_MPI">and why you created
</p><p class="standard_MPI">the mess you got yourself into in the first place.
</p><p class="standard_MPI">You're going to die a horrible death, remember.
</p><p class="standard_MPI">It's all good training, and you'll enjoy it
</p><p class="standard_MPI">more if you keep the facts
</p><p class="standard_MPI">in mind.
</p><br><p class="standard_MPI">Take your dying with some seriousness, however.
</p><p class="standard_MPI">Laughing on the way to your execution
</p><p class="standard_MPI">is not generally understood by less-advanced life-forms, and they'll
</p><p class="standard_MPI">call you crazy.
</p><br><p class="standard_M">"Have you read this, about losing your perspective, Don?" 

"No."
"It says you have to die a horrible death."
"You don't have to. Depends on the circumstances, and how you feel like arranging things."
"Are you going to die a horrible death?"
"I don't know. Not much point in it, would you think, now that I've quit the job? A quiet little ascension ought to be enough. I'll decide in a few weeks, when I finish what I came for."
I put him down for kidding, the way he did from time to time, and didn't know then that he was serious about the few weeks.
I went on into the book; it was the kind of knowledge a master would need, all right.
[I]Learningis finding outwhat you already know.Doing is demonstrating thatyou know it.Teaching is reminding othersthat they know just as well as you.
You are all learners, doers, teachers.
Your only obligation in any lifetimeis to be true to yourself.Being true to anyone else oranything else is not only impossible, but themark of a fakemessiah.
Thesimplest questionsare the most profound.Where were you born? Where is your home?Where are you going?What are you doing?
Think aboutthese once in a while, andwatch your answerschange.
[I]Youteach best what you most needto learn.
[NI]"You're awfully quiet over there, Richard," said Shimoda, as though he wanted to talk with me.
"Yeah," I said, and went on reading. If this was a book for masters only, I didn't want to let go of it.
[I]Livenever to beashamed if anything youdoor say is published around the world -even ifwhat is published is not true.
[I]Your friends will know you betterin the first minute you meetthanyour acquaintances will know you ina thousandyears.
The
best wayto avoid responsibilityis to say, "I've gotresponsibilities."
[NI]I noticed something strange about the book. "The pages don't have numbers on them, Don."
"No," he said. "You just open it and whatever you need most is there."
"A magic book!"
[NI]"No. You can do it with any book. You can do it with an old newspaper, if you read carefully enough. Haven't you done that, hold some problem in your mind, then open any book handy and see whatit tells you?"
"No."
"Well, try it sometime."
I tried. I closed my eyes and wondered what was going to happen to me if I stayed much longer with this strange person. It was fun to be with him, but I couldn't shake the sense that something not fun at all was going to happen to him before long, and I didn't want to be around when it did. Thinking that, I opened the book with my eyes still closed, then opened them and read.
[I[You are ledthrough your lifetimeby the inner learning creature,the playful spiritual beingthat is your real self,
Don't turn awayfrom possible futuresbefore you're certain you don't haveanything to learn from them.
You're always freeto change your mind andchoose a different future, ora differentpast.

[NI]Choose a different past? Literally or figuratively or how did it mean. .. ? "I think my mind just boggled, Don. I don't know how I could possibly learn this stuff."
"Practice. A little theory and a lot of practice," he said. "Take you about a week and a half."
"A week and a half."
"Yeah. Believe you know all answers, and you know all answers. Believe you're a master, and you are."
"I never said I wanted to be any master."
"That's right," he said. "You didn't."
But I kept the handbook, and he never asked for it back.
