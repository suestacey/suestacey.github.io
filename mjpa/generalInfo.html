<h2>The definitive app for practicing your patterns !</h2>

</p><p class="comic_navyblue_normal_18">If it's not possible for you to get to a Mah Jongg game RIGHT NOW, then this app will keep your mind fresh and focused on all the 2025 patterns.

</p><p class="comic_navyblue_bold_18">Gives you the piece of mind to practice those patterns without your sharky, quirky, or not so snarky, opponents hollering "That's It, Mah Jongg" in your ear every 10 minutes.

</p><p class="comic_navyblue_normal_18">I created this app, in 2019, to help me learn the patterns quickly.  I decided to share it with the rest of the community in 2020.

</p><p class="comic_navyblue_normal_18">The system also includes the ability to play the 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024  patterns.
