<h2>The definitive app for practicing your patterns !</h2>

</p><p class="comic_navyblue_normal_18">If it's not possible for you to get to a Mah Jongg game RIGHT NOW, then this app will keep your mind fresh and focused on all the 2020 patterns.

</p><p class="comic_navyblue_bold_18">Gives you the piece of mind to practice those patterns without your sharky, or not so sharky, opponents hollering "That's It, Mah Jongg" in your ear every 10 minutes.

</p><p class="comic_navyblue_normal_18">Last year I created this app to help me learn the 2019 patterns quickly.  I decided to share it with the rest of the community for 2020.
