<h2>The definitive app for practicing Western patterns !</h2>

</p><p class="comic_navyblue_normal_18">This version started because of a pattern called Three Philosophers, as shown in the The Mah Jong Player's Companion system, created by Patricia A Thompson and Betty Maloney.  As soon as I began to look closely at the pattern, I realized I couldn't program it in the same manual way I did with the National Mah Jongg League patterns.  The annual count for NMJL patterns is a total of 700-800 variations on average, for all of the yearly 60-70 basic patterns.

</p><p class="comic_navyblue_bold_18">
The variation count for Three Philosophers, alone, is 339,570. 

</p><p class="comic_navyblue_normal_18">I developed 2 systems for studying Mahj patterns.  The first system was developed for the National Mah Jongg League patterns.  I released it in 2019.  This system was developed to study the patterns for 2 Western variations:  The Mah Jong Player's Companion and Wright-Patternson Rules for Mah Jongg.
